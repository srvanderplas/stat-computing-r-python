Hopefully, you will get more exposure to simulation in both theory and methods courses down the line.\n\n## Pseudorandom Number Generation\n\nComputers are almost entirely deterministic, which makes it very difficult to come up with \"random\" numbers.\nIn addition to the deterministic nature of computing, it's also somewhat important to be able to run the same code and get the same results every time, which isn't possible if you rely on truly random numbers.\n\nHistorically, **pseudorandom** numbers were generated using linear congruential generators (LCGs) [@wikipediacontributorsLinearCongruentialGenerator2022].\nThese algorithms aren't typically used anymore, but they provide a good demonstration of how one might go about generating numbers that seem \"random\" but are actually deterministic.\nLCGs use modular arithmetic: $$X_{n+1} = (aX_n + c) \\mod m$$ where $X_0$ is the start value (the seed), $a$ is the multiplier, $c$ is the increment, and $m$ is the modulus.\nWhen using a LCG, the user generally specifies only the seed.\n\n![LCGs generate numbers which at first appear random, but once sufficiently many numbers have been generated, it is clear that there is some structure in the data. (Image from Wikimedia)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Lcg_3d.gif){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThe important thing to note here is that if you specify the same generator values ($a$, $c$, $m$, and $X_0$), you will always get the same series of numbers.\nSince $a$, $c$, $m$ are usually specified by the implementation, as a user, you should expect that if you specify the same seed, you will get the same results, every time.\n\n::: callout-warning\nIt is critically important to set your seed if you want the results to be reproducible and you are using an algorithm that depends on randomness.\n:::\n\nOnce you set your seed, the remaining results will only be reproducible if you generate the same amount of random numbers every time.\n\n::: column-margin\nI once helped a friend fit a model for their masters thesis using Simulated Annealing (which relies on random seeds).\nWe got brilliant results, but couldn't ever reproduce them, because I hadn't set the seed first and we never could figure out what the original seed was.\n😭\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n### Example: Setting Seeds for Reproducibility\n\n:::: panel-tabset\n#### R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(342512)\n\n# Get 10 numbers after the seed is set\nsample(1:100, 10)\n##  [1] 65 51 64 21 45 53  3  6 43  8\n\n# Compute something else that depends on randomness\nmean(rnorm(50))\n## [1] -0.1095366\n\n# Get 10 more numbers\nsample(1:100, 10)\n##  [1]  4 57 69 10 76 15 67  1  3 91\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Python\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport random\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a random generator with a specific seed\nrng = np.random.default_rng(342512)\n\n# Generate 10 integers\nrng.integers(low = 1, high = 100, size = 10)\n## array([18, 43, 71,  4, 35, 26, 41, 91, 42, 13])\n\n# Generate 500 std normal draws and take the mean\nnp.mean(rng.standard_normal(500))\n## np.float64(-0.008197259441979758)\n\n# Get 10 more numbers\nrng.integers(low = 1, high = 100, size = 10)\n## array([33, 38,  3, 95,  3, 58, 79,  3, 77, 23])\n```\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\nCompare the results above to these results:\n\n:::: panel-tabset\n#### R\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(342512)\n\n# Get 10 numbers after the seed is set\nsample(1:100, 10)\n##  [1] 65 51 64 21 45 53  3  6 43  8\n\n# Compute something else that depends on randomness\nmean(rnorm(30))\n## [1] -0.1936645\n\n# Get 10 more numbers\nsample(1:100, 10)\n##  [1]  49  37   6  34   9   3 100  43   7  29\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Python\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport random\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a random generator with a specific seed\nrng = np.random.default_rng(342512)\n\n# Generate 10 integers\nrng.integers(low = 1, high = 100, size = 10)\n## array([18, 43, 71,  4, 35, 26, 41, 91, 42, 13])\n\n# Generate 30 std normal draws and take the mean\nnp.mean(rng.standard_normal(30))\n## np.float64(0.3016849078747997)\n\n# Get 10 more numbers\nrng.integers(low = 1, high = 100, size = 10)\n## array([21, 49, 21, 99, 45,  1, 56, 70, 15, 82])\n```\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\nNotice how the results have changed?\n:::\n\nTo make my documents more reproducible, I will sometimes set a new seed at the start of an important chunk, even if I've already set the seed earlier.\nThis introduces certain \"fixed points\" where results won't change immediately after I've re-set the seed.\nThis is particularly important when I'm generating bootstrap estimates, fitting models, or simulating data for graphics experiments.\n\nPick your seed in any way you want.\nI tend to just randomly wiggle my fingers over the number keys, but I have also heard of people using the date in yyyymmdd format, favorite people's birthdays, the current time in hhmmss format... basically, you can use anything, so long as it's a valid integer. \n\n\n## Simulating from Probability Distributions\n\n### Using Built-in Simulation Functions\n\nOften, we can get away with simulating data from a known distribution. \nIn these cases, there is absolutely no point in DIY -- use the implementation that is available in R or Python, as it will be more numerically stable and much faster due to someone else having optimized the underlying C code. \n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### R\n\nYou can see the various distribution options using `?Distributions`.\nIn general, `dxxx` is the PDF/PMF, `pxxx` is the CDF, `qxxx` is the quantile function, and `rxxx` gives you random nubmers generated from the distribution.\n(`xxx`, obviously, is whatever distribution you're looking to use.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nset.seed(109025879)\n\ntibble(\n  norm = rnorm(500),\n  gamma = rgamma(500, shape = 3, scale = 1),\n  exp = rexp(500, rate = 1), #

Generate a random number $u \\sim U[0,1]$\n2. Find the inverse of the desired CDF, $x^\\ast = F^{-1}_X(u)$\n\n\nThis procedure can often be done in a vectorized manner, if the CDF and inverse CDF (or quantile function) are written with vectorization in mind. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Steps in Inverse Probability Sampling. First, we consider the CDF, which has a range of [0,1] over the domain of $x$. A uniform[0,1] random variable can be used to select a random position along the CDF's range, corresponding to the first step of the inverse probability sampling algorithm. Inverting the CDF produces a value $X^\u0007st$, which is a random sample from the distribution specified by the CDF $F(x)$.](01-simulation_files/figure-html/fig-inverse-prob-sketch-3.png){#fig-inverse-prob-sketch fig-alt='A three-panel figure showing the same CDF, which is 0 for x < 0, 1 for x > 1, and x^2 for 0 < x < 1.

First, we consider the density function. If we sample points from the rectangle enclosing the density function, we can keep only points below the density, and those points would have $x$ values corresponding to the probability distribution $f(x)$.](01-simulation_files/figure-html/fig-rejection-crude-sketch-1.png){#fig-rejection-crude-sketch fig-alt='A three-panel figure showing the same bimodal PDF with unspecified form over 0 < x < 10.

The third panel shows a blue histogram with the black PDF overlaid; the histogram is formed from the x coordinates of the points below $f(x)$ in the previous panel.' width=2400}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThink about throwing darts at this PDF (who hasn't wanted to do that?).\nAny darts that land below the line describing $f(x)$ would be distributed uniformly within the area under the curve, and their $x$ values would be a random sample from $f(x)$. \nRejection sampling is essentially a formalization of this idea. \n\nIn the crudest case, rejection sampling is essentially a Monte Carlo sampling method -- we generate random proposals from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and reject anything outside of our probability density. \nBut, we can usually improve over generating over the full $\\mathbb{R}^n$ -- in most cases, we can find a better proposal space. \nIn @fig-rejection-crude-sketch, we generated 2000 points and rejected 1034 of those points, for an acceptance rate of 48.3%. \n\nBut, what if we were a bit smarter about how we proposed points?\nBimodal distributions are irritating, because there's always that space in the middle between the modes, but, what if we could at least not \"throw darts\" at the top corners?\n\nThe idea here is to get an \"envelope distribution\" - a function that is greater than or equal to $f(x)$ at every point where $f(x) > 0$, and use that function to generate a proposal value.  Then, we can accept or reject that proposal value based on the relationship between our envelope distribution and $f(x)$. \nThis is essentially the same thing that we did before, but our \"envelope\" was very rectangular. \n\nWhat is interesting is that we can generate an \"envelope distribution\" from a distribution that isn't, strictly speaking, greater than $f(x)$, by using some fancy scaling.\n\nAn envelope distribution $g(x)$ can be used for rejection sampling if  $\\displaystyle \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\leq M$ for some constant $M<\\infty$.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Generate $u\\sim U[0,1]$\n2. Generate $x\\sim g(x)$, a proposal value\n3. Accept $x$ if $u < \\displaystyle\\frac{f(x)}{M g(x)}$; otherwise, start over. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Rejection Sampling with a Better Envelope. First, we consider the density function f(x) and an envelope function g(x) such that M g(x) > f(x) for a constant M < infinity. We can determine $M$ by the maximum of the ratio between f(x) and g(x) on the full domain $x$. Then, if we sample points from g(x) and accept those points when a uniform(0,1) RV u < f(x)/(M g(x)), this gives us a sample from f(x). Essentially, we keep the sample g(x) with probability scaled by the likelihood ratio between f and g at x. This is more adaptive than the rectangular proposal envelope but functionally works the same way.](01-simulation_files/figure-html/fig-rejection-better-sketch-1.png){#fig-rejection-better-sketch fig-alt='A three-panel figure showing the same bimodal PDF with unspecified form over 0 < x < 10.

We can reach all points in that square by using two independent uniform random random variables over the interval $[-1,1]$, i.e. when we generate two random values from U[-1,1], and use one as the $x$ coordinate and one as the $y$ coordinate, we get a point in the square. \nIf the sum of the squares of the coordinates are less than 1, the point will also fall inside the circle.
