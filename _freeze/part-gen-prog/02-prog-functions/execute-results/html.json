We'll revisit functions in @sec-functions, when we discuss how to write our own functions. \n\nThe **function call** is `add(x = 3, y = 2)`, where 3 and 2 are the arguments.\nThe function call is evaluated and **return**s 5 as the answer (assuming that `add` does what it says it does). \n\n::: demo\n\n### Function Vocabulary in Help Files {-}\n\nLet's see these words in a more concrete setting. \n\n![Small excerpt from the R reference card, showing the `which.max` and `which.min` functions](../images/gen-prog/function-vocab.png){fig-alt=\"An image which has the heading 'Data selection and manipulation', and below that has the text 'which.max(x) returns the index of the greatest element of x' and 'which.min(x) returns the index of the smallest element of x'.\"}\n\n- `which.max` and `which.min` are the function names\n- `x` is the parameter\n\nWhen I type `which.max(x = c(2:10))` into the R console and hit Enter, \n\n- `c(2:10) = c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)` is the argument\n- inside `which.max`, this argument has the name `x` (mostly helpful for debugging)\n- `which.max` will return 9, which is the index of `x` with the largest value (10)\n\n:::\n\n\n**Methods** are a special type of function that operate on a specific data type.\nIn Python, methods are applied using the syntax `variable.method_name()`.\nSo, you can get the length of a string variable `my_string` using `my_string.length()`.\n\nR has methods too, but they are invoked differently.\nIn R, you would get the length of a string variable using `length(my_string)`.\n\nRight now, it is not really necessary to know too much more about functions than this: you can invoke a function by passing in arguments, and the function will do a task and return the value.\n\n:::: example\n\n### Your Turn: Cheat Sheet Exploration and Using Functions  {-}\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n#### Problem\n\nTry out some of the functions mentioned on the R and Python cheat sheets.\n\nCan you figure out how to define a list or vector of numbers?\nIf so, can you use a function to calculate the maximum value?\n\nCan you find the R functions that will allow you to repeat a string variable multiple times or concatenate two strings?\n\nCan you do this task in Python?\n\n#### R Solution\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Define a vector of numbers\nx <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# Calculate the maximum\nmax(x)\n## [1] 5\n\n# function to repeat a variable multiple times\nrep(\"test\", 3)\n## [1] \"test\" \"test\" \"test\"\n# Concatenate strings, using \"ing... \" as the separator\npaste(rep(\"test\", 3), collapse = \"ing... \")\n## [1] \"testing... testing... test\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Python Solution\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n# Define a list of numbers\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Calculate the maximum\nmax(x)\n## 5\n\n# Repeat a string multiple times\nx = (\"test\", )*3 # String multiplication \n                 # have to use a tuple () to get separate items\n# Then use 'yyy'.join(x) to paste items of x together with yyy as separators\n'ing...

Unlike a physical library, though, usually you don't have to return the packages you've checked out!\n\nThe set of packages you have installed corresponds to the books you have at home. \nYou can use any of the functions (pages of those books) when you want to program (or access information). \n\n::: {#fig-environment layout-ncol=4}\n\n![Package Repository. <br/>[Image Source](https://images.rawpixel.com/image_social_landscape/cHJpdmF0ZS9sci9pbWFnZXMvd2Vic2l0ZS8yMDIyLTA1L3NrMTk4Ni1pbWFnZS1rd3Z4YXZiaC5qcGc.jpg)](../images/gen-prog/dublin-college-library.jpg){fig-alt=\"Image of Dublin College Library, containing two full stories of bookshelves, row by row, with a beautiful arched ceiling connecting the two aisles of books.\" height=\"150px\"}\n\n![Locally Installed Packages (my bookshelf)](../images/gen-prog/my_bookshelf.jpg){fig-alt=\"A single row of books stacked horizontally and vertically on a shelf.\"  height=\"150px\"}\n\n![One Package with many functions (pages)](../images/gen-prog/single-book.jpg){fig-alt=\"A single book (R Packages by Hadley Wickham).\" height=\"150px\"}\n\n![One function (single page) from a package.](../images/gen-prog/book-page.jpg){fig-alt=\"A single page from the book R Packages by Hadley Wickham.\" height=\"150px\"}\n\nA package repository, like PyPi or CRAN, contains a set of possible packages to install (but, of course, there are packages that you can install from other places, as well). Once you have installed a package, you have a local library, like the books I keep near my computer. Each book has (usually) a coherent topic, and each page has a different set of information, corresponding in this analogy to a different function. \n\n:::\n\nHow the packages are **organized** can reasonably differ based on how you prefer your house to be arranged, just as package organization differs significantly in R and Python. \n\n- Python virtual environments arrange packages by project location, so that the package versions needed for each project are stored together, and other projects may have different versions.    \nAnalogy: Books in my house are sorted by task and audience (programming books at my desk, fiction books near the couch, kid books in their bedrooms). \n\n- R packages, by default, are installed in user libraries or system wide, and the same package version is used for all projects.     \nAnalogy: All books in the house are kept in a single wall-to-wall set of bookshelves in the living room.\n\n\nThe **global environment** (R) or **object space** (Python) is the collection of objects (functions, variables, etc.) that are immediately available to the user. \n\nRegardless of how packages are managed (virtual environments or centrally), to access the package's functions, I have to go get the book and open it. \nThis step corresponds most closely to **loading a package** into your global environment/object environment. \n\nAgain, R and Python prefer to manage this step differently.\n\n- In R, functions from all loaded packages are available to the user directly using the function name.\nWhen multiple packages with lots of functions are loaded, this can be ... messy, as in @fig-env-mgmt-R. \n\n- In Python, the recommended way to load packages is to import the package and possibly give it a shorter alias; the functions must still be referenced as `pkg.functionName` or `alias.functionName` instead of just `functionName`. This more closely matches @fig-env-mgmt-py, where pages are still contained in notebooks, and thus require an extra step to access. \n\n::: {#fig-env-mgmt layout-ncol=2}\n\n![R environment mangement <br/>[Image source](https://southblueprint.com/28045/opinions/my-backpack-looks-like-a-mess-and-i-am-okay-with-it/)](../images/gen-prog/messy-backpack.jpg){#fig-env-mgmt-R fig-alt=\"A backpack full of looseleaf papers in a jumble\" width=\"30%\"}\n\n![Python environment management <br/>[Image source](https://images.rawpixel.com/image_800/cHJpdmF0ZS9zdGF0aWMvaW1hZ2Uvd2Vic2l0ZS8yMDIyLTA0L2xyL3B4NTM2Njc2LWltYWdlLWt3dnZlcm44LmpwZw.jpg)](../images/gen-prog/notebooks.jpg){#fig-env-mgmt-py fig-alt=\"A stack of spiral notebooks\" width=\"30%\"}\n\nR and python conventions for environments are different -- in R, all package functions are loaded into the environment as single objects, which can get messy if there are a lot of functions and/or a lot of loaded packages. In Python, package functions are typically loaded within their packages, so the chaos is more contained, but you have an additional step of having to find the function within the specific package containing that function. This is more verbose, but also ensures that you don't have conflicts between two functions in different packages with the same name. \n\n:::\n\n<!-- End vocabulary by analogy section -->\n\n::: {.advanced}\n\n### Advanced: Python-like R environments {-}\n\nSome R programmers have adopted the python philosophy of project-specific package management, using an R package called `renv` [@usheyIntroductionRenv2023].\n\n`renv` documentation can be found [here](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) if you wish to try it out. I find that it is most useful for projects where package updates may break things - e.g. projects which run on shared systems or which are intended to work for a long period of time without maintenance. \n\nIf you want to use `renv`, you can do that by following these steps:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"renv\")\n\nlibrary(renv)\n\n# Activate renv for a project\nrenv::activate()\n\n# this will install from github or CRAN\nrenv::install(c(\"pkg1\", \"pkg2\", \"githubuser/pkg3\")) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nI use `renv` for this textbook, because if a package update breaks things, I need to systematically check *all* the code chunks in the textbook to make sure they all work. I don't want to do that every time someone fixes a minor bug, so I don't update the packages the textbook uses more than once a semester (normally). \n\n:::\n\n\n### Python Environments\n\nIn Python, packages are usually managed at the project level by creating **virtual environments**. \nThe different environment management options in Python are one of the things that can make starting to learn python so difficult - it can be hard to make sure you're using the right environment.\n`virtualenv` and `conda` are the main options for environment management.\n`conda` is sometimes preferred for scientific computing because it handles the complex dependencies that arise from large packages like `numpy` and `scipi` and `pandas` a bit better than `pip` does alone.\n\nBy default, @sec-setting-up just installs python at the system level.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n#### Decision Fatigued?  {-}\n\nIf you don't care about the nuances of which python environment management option you should use, follow the `venv` instructions for Python below using the R console. \n`venv` is relatively simple and straightforward and has less overhead. \n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n\n#### Consistency is critical {-}\n\nI *highly* recommend that you **pick one of these options and use it consistently**, rather than trying the advantages and disadvantages of each option in different projects.\nIf you switch around between virtualenv and conda, you can very quickly reach the point where you have 15 different python environments on your computer and you don't have any idea which one you should be using. \nPython environment management is one of the hardest things to deal with as a beginner Python programmer. \n\n[![Python Environment, by Randall Munroe.

extending the language with user-written **packages**.\nThese packages will give you access to features that aren't present in the base language, including new statistical methods, all sorts of plotting and visualization libraries, ways of interacting with data that are **way** more convenient than the default base language methods, and more.\n\n\n### Package repositories\n\nBoth R and Python have package systems, though generally, R is a bit more straightforward to deal with than python (in my opinion). \nPython's extra environment management systems sometimes come with additional package repositories, and it can be hard to identify the differences between them. \nBy contrast, all R packages seem to go through the same basic installation process and are just hosted in different places.\nThis is largely a result of the difference between R and Python's environment management strategies. \n\n\n|        | Formally Published

(Advanced) {-}\n\nThere are tons of considerations to think about when using a new package, like how well it's maintained, how many dependencies it has, and whether the developers of the package prioritize backwards-compatibility.\n\nWith each package you add, your project becomes more complex. \nOn the other hand, with each package you add, you should be able to do more things, and hopefully, you'll be able to leverage code from other developers to accomplish more complex tasks.\n\nThere's a critical balance between complexity and trying not to reinvent the wheel. \nAs you go through this book, you may want to consider the different packages presented in light of this complexity cost/benefit analysis.\n\n:::\n\n\nBefore we talk about how to install packages, we need to step back and think a little bit about the pros and cons of different ways of managing packages, because the most common R and python setups use very different approaches.\n\n### Package Installation\n\n#### Installing packages in Python {#sec-py-pkg-install}\n\nMany of the instructions here are modified from @makarovUsePythonRstudio2022.\n\nWhichever method (venv, conda) you use to manage your Python environment, when you go to install a new package, you have a few different options for how to do so. \n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n##### System console\n\nIn python, you will typically want to install packages using a system terminal.\n\n1. Make sure your virtual environment/conda environment is activated \n2. Installation commands:\n    - If you are using venv, `pip3 install <package name>` should install your package. \n    - If you are using conda, `conda install <package name>` is preferable, and if that doesn't work, then try using `pip3 install <package name>`.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\n# If you're using virtualenv\npip install <pkg1>\n\n# If you're using conda, try this first\nconda install <pkg1>\n# If that fails, try pip\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n##### RStudio\n\n1. Make sure R is using the correct python installation\n2. In the R terminal, run `reticulate::py_install(\"package name\")`\n\n##### IPython Magic\n\nThis is less elegant, but nearly foolproof because RStudio will install the package in the version of python it can find. \n\n1. At the top of the chunk, write `%pip install <package name>`\n2. Run this code (Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)\n3. **Comment the code out**, so that you aren't reinstalling the package every time you run the chunk. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n%pip install <pkg1>\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nA slightly less elegant but more robust way to do this is to use the `sys` package. \nLoading the `sys` package ensures that you're using the version of python that your file will be compiled with to install the package.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport sys\n# For pip installation\n!{sys.executable} -m pip install <pkg1>\n\n# For conda installation\n!{sys.executable} -m conda install <pkg1>\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've installed the package on your machine, you can comment these lines out so that they don't run every time - this makes it a bit easier when you try to run old code on a new machine, as you can just uncomment those lines.\n\n:::\n\n#### Installing packages in R\n\nPackage management in R is a bit simpler than package management in python.\n\nIn almost every case, you can install packages from CRAN with `install.packages(\"package name\")`. \nIf your package is not on CRAN, and is instead on e.g. GitHub, you may have to use the `remotes` package to install it with `remotes::install_github(\"user/repo\")`\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# CRAN packages\ninstall.packages(\"<pkg1>\")\n\n# Github packages\nremotes::install_github(\"username/reponame\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n:::: demo\n\n#### Demo: Package Installation\n\nSuppose you want to install the `lme4` package in R and the corresponding `pymer4` package in  python. \n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n##### R\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"lme4\") # <1>\n\nremotes::install_github(\"lme4/lme4\", dependencies=TRUE) # <2>\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n1. Install the package from CRAN (best choice if you don't know you need the development version).\n2. Install the development version of the package from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lme4/lme4). \n\nYou should only run one of these lines of code, and if you don't know which one to run, then stick with the first line.\n\n##### Python (System console)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\npip install pymer4 # venv\n\nconda install pymer4 # conda\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n##### Python (RStudio)\n\nIn the R terminal (yes, that's weird), run this command: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreticulate::py_install(\"pymer4\")\n## Using virtual environment '/home/susan/.virtualenvs/book' ...\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n##### Python (Ipython magic)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n%pip install pymer4\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n### Loading Packages\n\nOnce you have the package installed, you need to load the package into memory so that you can use the functions and data contained within.\nAgain, R and python differ slightly in how programmers conventionally handle this process.\n\n-   R: Load all of the package's functions, overwriting already loaded functions if necessary\n-   Python: Load all of the package's functions, contained within an object that is either the package name or a shortened alias.\n\nNow, both R and python can load packages in either way, so this isn't an either/or thing - it's about knowing what the conventions of the language are, and then deciding whether or not it is appropriate to follow those conventions in your project.\n@fig-env-mgmt contains a visual analogy for the differences between these two approaches. \n\n\n#### R's Package Strategy: Import the whole package and all functions\n\n:::: demo\n\nTo demonstrate this approach, let's create a simple plot with a plotting library (`ggplot2` in R, `seaborn` in Python).\nWe'll first load the library (R) or libraries (Python), and then we can look at how many functions are available to the user. \nWe can plot the number of functions loaded from each package using a bar plot. \n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n##### R\n\nAll of the other packages except for `ggplot2` in this plot are present by default in any new R environment.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\npkgs <- search() # <1>\npkgs <- pkgs[grep(\"package:\",pkgs)] # <2>\nall_fns <- lapply(pkgs, function(x) as.character(lsf.str(x))) # <3>\npkg_fns <- data.frame(pkg = rep(pkgs, sapply(all_fns, length)), # <4>\n                      fn = unlist(all_fns))\npkg_fns$pkg <- gsub(\"package:\", \"\", pkg_fns$pkg) # <5>\n\n\nggplot(pkg_fns, aes(x = pkg, y = after_stat(count), fill = pkg)) + # <6>\n  geom_bar() + theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  ylab(\"# Functions\") + xlab(\"Package\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](02-prog-functions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png){fig-alt='Plot of number of functions loaded with each package in a new R environment.
