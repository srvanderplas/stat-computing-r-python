Logical indexing. -->\n\n<!-- Lego pictures made with https://www.mecabricks.com/en/workshop -->\n\nThis chapter introduces some of the most important structures for storing and working with data: vectors, matrices, lists, and data frames. \n\n## {{< fa bullseye >}} Objectives {.intro}\n\n- Understand the differences between lists, vectors, data frames, matrices, and arrays in R and python\n- Be able to use location-based indexing in R or python to pull out subsets of a complex data object\n\n::: {.callout-caution .intro}\n## Python Package Installation \n\nYou will need the `numpy` and `pandas` packages for this section. Pick one of the following ways to install python packages:\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### System Terminal\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\npip3 install numpy pandas lxml\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### R Terminal\n\nThis package installation method requires that you have a virtual environment set up (that is, if you are on Windows, don't try to install packages this way).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreticulate::py_install(c(\"numpy\", \"pandas\", \"lxml\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Python Terminal\n\nIn a python chunk (or the python terminal), you can run the following command. This depends on something called [\"IPython magic\"](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#) commands, so if it doesn't work for you, try the System Terminal method instead.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n%pip3 install numpy pandas lxml\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Data Structures Overview {.intro}\n\nIn @sec-basic-var-types, we discussed 4 different data types: strings/characters, numeric/double/floats, integers, and logical/booleans. As you might imagine, things are about to get more complicated.\n\nData **structures** are more complex arrangements of information, but they are still (usually) created using the same data types we have previously discussed. \n\n|             | Homogeneous   | Heterogeneous |\n|-------------|---------------|---------------|\n| 1D          | vector        | list          |\n| 2D          | matrix        | data frame    |\n| N-D         | array         |               |\n\n::: callout-warning\n### Opinionated Structures\n\nThose of you who have taken programming classes that were more computer science focused will realize that I am leaving out a lot of information about lower-level structures like pointers. \nI'm making a deliberate choice to gloss over most of those details in this chapter, because it's already hard enough to learn 2 languages worth of data structures at a time.\nIn addition, R doesn't have pointers [No Pointers in R, @matloffArtProgrammingTour2011], so leaving out this material in python streamlines teaching both two languages, at the cost of overly simplifying some python concepts. \nIf you want to read more about the Python concepts I'm leaving out, check out @frippAnswerPythonPandas2016.\n\n:::\n\nIn any data structure, it's important to be able to pull smaller pieces of data out of the structure. \nWe do this via **indexing**. \n\nThere are three main approaches to accessing information using indexes:\n\n1. Object Names    \nIn some cases, components of a data structure are **named** and can be accessed using those names.\n\n2. Location    \nThink of a location index as accessing the nth item in a list, or accessing cell A5 in an Excel spreadsheet - you have strict directions as to what row/column or item to get. \n\n3. Logical Indexing    \nIn a logical index, you access all items in a structure for which a condition is TRUE. This would be like making a list of family members, and then assigning bedtimes using a statement like \"all of the children go to bed at 8pm\" - first you decide whether a person is a child, and then you can assign the appropriate bedtime if child is true.\n\nIn both R and Python, we will primarily use square brackets to index different data types. \nWhen the data type is rectangular (has both rows and columns), we will use `[row, column]` syntax -- that is, `[1, 3]` says access the first row, third column. \nWhen the data type is a vector, we will use `[item]` indexing.\n\nAnother important difference to keep in mind is that in R, items are 1-indexed -- that is, the first item in a list `x` is `x[1]`. \nIn Python, on the other hand, items are 0-indexed -- the first item in a list `y` is `y[0]`. \n\n\n## Vectors\n\nA **vector** is a one-dimensional column of homogeneous data. \n**Homogeneous** means that every element in a vector has the same data type.\n\nWe can have vectors of any data type and length we want: \n\n![vectors of different data types](../images/gen-prog/lego-set-of-vectors.png){fig-alt=\"A picture of several stacks of lego bricks. First, there is a set of green-hued 1x1 bricks labeled `int`. Next, there is a set of red-hued 1x1 bricks labeled `lgl`, or logical. Then, there is a set of blue-hued 1x2 bricks labeled `float` and finally, a set of 1x3 purple-hued bricks labeled string. Each set of colored bricks has a different length.\"}\n\n\n### Indexing by Location {#sec-indexing}\n\nEach element in a vector has an **index** - an integer telling you what the item's position within the vector is. I'm going to demonstrate indices with the string vector\n\n| R                                                                         | Python                                                                              |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| 1-indexed language                                                        | 0-indexed language                                                                  |\n| Count elements as 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., N                                      | Count elements as 0, 1, 2, 3, , ..., N-1                                            |\n| ![R lego vector, labeled with numbers 1-12](../images/gen-prog/lego-1x3-vector-R.png) | ![Python lego vector, labeled with numbers 0-11](../images/gen-prog/lego-1x3-vector-python.png) |\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### R {.unnumbered}\n\nIn R, we create vectors with the `c()` function, which stands for \"concatenate\" -

if you are interested in these definitions, see @sec-matrix-calcs. \n\n#### Element-wise Operations\n\nWhen using numeric vectors, the element-wise operations are the same for vectors and scalars (@tbl-math-operators2 is the same exact table as @tbl-math-operators in @sec-calculator). \n\n| Operation        | R symbol | Python symbol |\n|------------------|----------|---------------|\n| Addition         | `+`      | `+`           |\n| Subtraction      | `-`      | `-`           |\n| Multiplication   | `*`      | `*`           |\n| Division         | `/`      | `/`           |\n| Integer Division | `%/%`    | `//`          |\n| Modular Division | `%%`     | `%`           |\n| Exponentiation   | `^`      | `**`          |\n\n: Element-wise mathematical operators in R and Python {#tbl-math-operators2}\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n##### R\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\na <- c(1:5)\nb <- c(6:10)\n\na + b\n## [1]  7  9 11 13 15\nb - a\n## [1] 5 5 5 5 5\na * b\n## [1]  6 14 24 36 50\nb / a\n## [1] 6.000000 3.500000 2.666667 2.250000 2.000000\nb %/% a\n## [1] 6 3 2 2 2\nb %% a\n## [1] 0 1 2 1 0\na ^ b\n## [1]       1     128    6561  262144 9765625\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n##### Python\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nb = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\n\na + b\n## array([ 7,  9, 11, 13, 15])\nb - a\n## array([5, 5, 5, 5, 5])\na * b\n## array([ 6, 14, 24, 36, 50])\nb / a\n## array([6.        , 3.5       , 2.66666667, 2.25      , 2.        ])\nb // a\n## array([6, 3, 2, 2, 2])\nb % a\n## array([0, 1, 2, 1, 0])\na ** b \n## array([      1,     128,    6561,  262144, 9765625])\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Vector-to-Scalar Operations\n\nLet's cover a few built-in or commonly-used vector summary operations here, focusing on those which are most useful for statistics. \n\nFunction | R | Python\n---- | ---- | ----\nlength | `length(x)` | `len(x)`\nmean | `mean(x)` | `x.average()`\nvariance | `var(x)` | `x.var()`\nstandard deviation | `sd(x)` | `x.std()`\nmaximum | `max(x)` | `x.max()`\nlocation of maximum | `which.max(x)` | `x.argmax()`\nminimum | `min(x)` | `x.min()`\nlocation of minimum | `which.min(x)` | `x.argmin()`\n\n::: panel-tabset\n##### R\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(30420983)\nx <- sample(1:100, size = 10)\nx\n##  [1] 43 91 25 40 60 39 18 53 58 99\nlength(x)\n## [1] 10\nmean(x)\n## [1] 52.6\nvar(x)\n## [1] 678.4889\nsd(x)\n## [1] 26.04782\nmax(x)\n## [1] 99\nmin(x)\n## [1] 18\nwhich.max(x)\n## [1] 10\nwhich.min(x)\n## [1] 7\n \n# 5 number summary + mean\nsummary(x)\n##    Min. 1st Qu.

a file, a table on a webpage, etc. \nWe're not going to go into the finer points of this (you'll get into that in @sec-data-input), but it is useful to know how to read neatly formatted data.\n\nOne source of (relatively neat) data is the [TidyTuesday github repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)^[Tidy Tuesday is a collaborative project where the R community gets together and explores a dataset, cleaning it, visualizing it, and generally working to collectively hone R skills together.

Another handy function in pandas is .info(), which you can use to show the number of non-NA values. This is particularly useful in sparse datasets where there may be a LOT of missing values and you may want to find out which columns have useful information for more than just a few rows.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## References  {#sec-data-struct-refs}\n\n",
