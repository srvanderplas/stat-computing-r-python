Please try to emulate the first version!\n\n### Python {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nx = 3\ny = 1\n\nif x > 2:\n  y = 8\nelse:\n  y = 4\n\nprint(\"x =\", x, \"; y =\", y)\n## x = 3 ; y = 8\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIn python, all code grouping is accomplished with spaces instead of with brackets. \nSo in python, we write our if statement as `if x > 2:` with the colon indicating that what follows is the code to evaluate. \nThe next line is indented with 2 spaces to show that the code on those lines belongs to that if statement. \nThen, we use the else: statement to provide an alternative set of code to run if the logical condition in the if statement is false. \nAgain, we indent the code under the else statement to show where it \"belongs\".\n\n\n<!-- https://www.py4e.com/html3/03-conditional -->\n:::\n\n::: callout-warning\nPython will throw errors if you mess up the spacing. \nThis is one thing that is very annoying about Python... but it's a consequence of trying to make the code more readable.\n:::\n\n### Representing Conditional Statements as Diagrams\n\nA common way to represent conditional logic is to draw a flow chart diagram.\n\nIn a flow chart, conditional statements are represented as diamonds, and other code is represented as a rectangle. \nYes/no or True/False branches are labeled. \nTypically, after a conditional statement, the program flow returns to a single point.\n\n![Program flow diagram outline of a simple if/else statement](../images/gen-prog/flow-chart1.png)\n\n### Chaining Conditional Statements: Else-If\n\nIn many cases, it can be helpful to have a long chain of conditional statements describing a sequence of alternative statements.\n\n::: callout-warning\n### Example - Conditional Evaluation\n\nSuppose I want to determine what categorical age bracket someone falls into based on their numerical age. \nAll of the bins are mutually exclusive - you can't be in the 25-40 bracket and the 41-55 bracket.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### Program Flow Map {.unnumbered}\n\n![Program flow map for a series of mutually exclusive categories. If our goal is to take a numeric age variable and create a categorical set of age brackets, such as \\<18, 18-25, 26-40, 41-55, 56-65, and \\>65, we can do this with a series of if-else statements chained together. Only one of the bracket assignments is evaluated, so it is important to place the most restrictive condition first.](../images/gen-prog/age-category-prog-flow.png)\n\nThe important thing to realize when examining this program flow map is that if `age <= 18` is true, then **none of the other conditional statements even get evaluated**. \nThat is, once a statement is true, none of the other statements matter. \nBecause of this, it is important to place the most restrictive statement first.\n\n![Program flow map for a series of mutually exclusive categories, emphasizing that only some statements are evaluated. When age = 40, only (age \\<= 18), (age \\<= 25), and (age \\<= 40) are evaluated conditionally. Of the assignment statements, only bracket = '26-40' is evaluated when age = 40.](../images/gen-prog/age-category-prog-flow2.png)\n\nIf for some reason you wrote your conditional statements in the wrong order, the wrong label would get assigned:\n\n![Program flow map for a series of mutually exclusive categories, with category labels in the wrong order - \\<40 is evaluated first, and so \\<= 25 and \\<= 18 will never be evaluated and the wrong label will be assigned for anything in those categories.](../images/gen-prog/age-category-prog-flow3.png)\n\nIn code, we would write this statement using `else-if` (or `elif`) statements.\n\n#### R {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nage <- 40 # change this as you will to see how the code works\n\nif (age < 18) {\n  bracket <- \"<18\"\n} else if (age <= 25) {\n  bracket <- \"18-25\"\n} else if (age <= 40) {\n  bracket <- \"26-40\"\n} else if (age <= 55) {\n  bracket <- \"41-55\" \n} else if (age <= 65) {\n  bracket <- \"56-65\"\n} else {\n  bracket <- \">65\"\n}\n\nbracket\n## [1] \"26-40\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Python {.unnumbered}\n\nPython uses `elif` as a shorthand for `else if` statements.

Any time you find yourself copy-pasting code and changing values, you should consider using a loop (or eventually a function) instead.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Loops\n\n<!-- https://www.py4e.com/html3/05-iterations -->\n\nOften, we write programs which update a variable in a way that the new value of the variable depends on the old value:\n\n    x = x + 1\n\nThis means that we add one to the current value of `x`.\n\nBefore we write a statement like this, we have to **initialize** the value of `x` because otherwise, we don't know what value to add one to.\n\n    x = 0\n    x = x + 1\n\nWe sometimes use the word **increment** to talk about adding one to the value of `x`; **decrement** means subtracting one from the value of `x`.\n\nA particularly powerful tool for making these types of repetitive changes in programming is the **loop**, which executes statements a certain number of times. \nLoops can be written in several different ways, but all loops allow for executing a block of code a variable number of times.\n\n### While Loops\n\nIn the previous section, we discussed conditional statements, where a block of code is only executed *if* a logical statement is true.\nThe simplest type of loop is the **while** loop, which executes a block of code until a statement is no longer true.\n\n::: callout-warning\n#### Example - While Loops\n::: panel-tabset\n##### Flow Map\n\n![Flow map showing while-loop pseudocode (while x \\<= N) { \\# code that changes x in some way} and the program flow map expansion where we check if x \\> N (exiting the loop if true); otherwise, we continue into the loop, execute the main body of #code and then change x and start over.](../images/gen-prog/while-loop-flow.png)\n\n##### R {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 0\n\nwhile (x < 10) { \n  # Everything in here is executed \n  # during each iteration of the loop\n  print(x)\n  x <- x + 1\n}\n## [1] 0\n## [1] 1\n## [1] 2\n## [1] 3\n## [1] 4\n## [1] 5\n## [1] 6\n## [1] 7\n## [1] 8\n## [1] 9\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n##### Python {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nx = 0\n\nwhile x < 10:\n  print(x)\n  x = x + 1\n## 0\n## 1\n## 2\n## 3\n## 4\n## 5\n## 6\n## 7\n## 8\n## 9\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Try it Out - While Loops\n\n::: panel-tabset\n##### Problem {.unnumbered}\n\nWrite a while loop that verifies that $$\\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\prod_{k=1}^N \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{k^2}\\right) = \\frac{e^\\pi - e^{-\\pi}}{2\\pi}.$$\n\nTerminate your loop when you get within 0.0001 of $\\frac{e^\\pi - e^{-\\pi}}{2\\pi}$.

So we define `k=1`, `prod = 1`, and `ans` before the loop starts. Then, we loop over `k`, multiplying `prod` by $(1 + 1/k^2)$ and then incrementing $k$ by one each time. At each iteration, we test whether `prod` is close enough to `ans` to stop the loop.\n\n##### R Solution {.unnumbered}\n\nIn R, you will use `pi` and `exp()` - these are available by default without any additional libraries or packages.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nk <- 1\nprod <- 1\nans <- (exp(pi) - exp(-pi))/(2*pi)\ndelta <- 0.0001\n\nwhile (abs(prod - ans) >= 0.0001) {\n  prod <- prod * (1 + 1/k^2)\n  k <- k + 1\n}\n\nk\n## [1] 36761\nprod\n## [1] 3.675978\nans\n## [1] 3.676078\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n##### Python solution {.unnumbered}\n\nNote that in python, you will have to import the math library to get the values of pi and the `exp` function.
