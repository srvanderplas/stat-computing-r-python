Get the R installer from CRAN: <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/>\n\n2. Install the Rtools4 package that matches the R version you installed: <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/>    \nFor example, if you installed R 4.4.3, you should download RTools 4.4. If you installed R 4.0.1, you should install RTools 4.0. \n\n##### {{< fa brands apple >}} Mac {.unnumbered}\n\n1. Get the R installer from CRAN: <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/>\n\n2. Install XCode - a set of developer tools - so that you can install R packages more easily. There are two ways to do this:\n\n  a. Get XCode [from the App store directly](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (simple, but you may have to do other things later)\n  b. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and then use homebrew to install XCode.^[If you prefer a different package manager, that's fine - Homebrew is widely used, but there are other options. Ultimately, you just need to have XCode so that you can compile R packages.] \n  \nI personally suggest option b, because Homebrew is used for a lot of different software-development related things, and having it will make life easier later. \n\n---\n\n###### Installing Homebrew + XCode {-}\n\n```\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n```\n\n```\nbrew install mas # Search the apple store\nmas search xcode # find xcode\nmas install 497799835 # install the program by ID\n```\n  \n\n##### {{< fa brands linux >}} Linux  {.unnumbered}\n\nIf you're using a distribution like Debian, Fedora, RedHat, or Ubuntu, or a distribution derived from one of these distributions, follow the instructions below.\n\nIf you don't know your distribution (or if you're working on a derivative distribution, like Mint), you can figure out which set of instructions to follow by executing `lsb_release -a` in your system terminal.\n\nIf you're using Arch or another distribution that isn't derived from something listed above, google for instructions specific to your distribution - these instructions cover the most common, user-friendly distributions, but if you've chosen something more niche, it is assumed you can figure out how to install R. (If that isn't the case, leave a comment below with your distribution, so I know how best to update this book.)\n\n---\n\n###### Installation Instructions {-}\n\n1. Get the R installer from CRAN: <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/> -  pick your distribution, and follow the distribution-specific instructions from there. \n\n\nYou could install R using your package manager, but often this version is out of date. The instructions for each version will get you a more up-to-date version that will be easier to work with.\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n:::: setup\n### Install Python\n\nDownload and install the latest version of [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n\n\n\n#### Extra Instructions to Setup Python on  {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows {-}\n\n**check the box that asks if you want to add Python to the system path.**    \nThis will save you a *lot* of time and frustration. \nIf you didn't do this, you can follow [these instructions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-add-python-to-windows-path/) to fix the issue (you'll need to restart your machine).\n\n::::\n\n:::: learnmore\n\n-   If you're interested in python, you should install Jupyter using the instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install) (I would just do `pip3 install jupyterlab`)\\\n    We will not use jupyter much in this book - I prefer quarto - but the python community has decided to distribute code primarily in jupyter notebooks, so having it on your machine may be useful so that you can run other people's code.\n\n-   [Additional instructions for installing Python 3](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/install) from Python for Everybody if you have trouble.\n\n::::\n\n:::: setup\n### Install RStudio\n\nDownload and install the [latest version of RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download) for your operating system. \nRStudio is a integrated development environment (IDE) for R, created by Posit.\nIt contains a set of tools designed to make writing R, python, javascript, and other data-related code easier.\n::::\n\n:::: setup\n### Install `quarto`\n\nDownload and install the [latest version of Quarto](https://quarto.org/#getting-started) for your operating system.\n    Quarto is a command-line tool released by Posit that allows you to create documents using R or python, combining code, results, and written text.\n\nThe following steps may be helpful or required for your class.\nIf you want to be safe, go ahead and complete these steps as well.\n::::\n\n:::: setup\n### Install `git`\n\n1. Install git using the instructions [here](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html).    \n2. Consult the [troubleshooting guide](https://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting.html) if you have issues. \n\n\n::: callout-warning\n#### {{< fa brands apple >}} Mac Warning\n\nWith each OS version upgrade, you may find that git breaks. To fix it, you will have to re-install Mac command line tools. Once you do this, git will start working again. See @dustbusterAnswerGitNot2018 for more information.\n:::\n\n\n#### Optional: Install a git client\n\n[Instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html)\n\nI don't personally use a git client other than RStudio, but you may prefer to have a client that allows you to use a point-and-click interface. Some of the features are built into RStudio, but I'm sure there are other features that aren't and I just don't use them frequently.\n\n\n#### GitHub: Git on the Web {#sec-setting-up-github}\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n##### Set up a GitHub Account Now\n[Instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html) for setting up a GitHub account. \n\nBe sure you remember your signup email, username, and password - you will need them later.\n:::\n\nGit is a program that runs on your machine and keeps track of changes to files that you tell it to monitor. GitHub is a website that hosts people's git repositories. You can use git without GitHub, but you can't use GitHub without git. \n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n##### Git and Github: Slightly crude (but memorable) analogy {-}\n\nGit is to GitHub what Porn is to PornHub. Specifically, GitHub hosts git repositories publicly, while PornHub hosts porn publicly. But it would be silly to equate porn and PornHub, and it's similarly silly to think of GitHub as the only place you can use git repositories.\n:::\n\nIf you want, you can hook Git up to GitHub, and make a copy of your local git repository that lives in the cloud. Then, if you configure things correctly, your local repository will talk to GitHub without too much trouble. Using Github with Git allows you to **easily make a cloud backup of your important code**, so that even if your  computer suddenly catches on fire, all of your important code files exist somewhere else. \n\nRemember: any data you don't have in 3 different places is data you don't care about.^[Yes, I'm aware that this sounds paranoid. It's been a very rare occasion that I've needed to restore something from another backup. You don't want to take chances. I knew a guy who had to retype his entire masters thesis from the printed out version the night before it was due because he had stored it on a network drive that was decommissioned. You don't want to be that person.]\n\n\n#### Introduce yourself to git\n\nYou need to tell git what your name and email address are, because every \"commit\" you make will be signed. This needs to be done once on each computer you're using.\n\nFollow the instructions [here](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html), or run the lines below: \n\n::: callout-note\nThe lines of code below use **interactive prompts**. Click the copy button in the upper right corner of the box below, and then paste the *whole thing* into the R console. You will see a line that says \"Your full name:\" - type your name into the console. Similarly, the next line will ask you for an email address.)\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuser_name <- readline(prompt = \"Your full name: \")\nuser_email <- readline(prompt = \"The address associated w your github account: \")\n\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\nlibrary(usethis)\n\nuse_git_config(user.name = user_name, user.email = user_email, scope = \"user\")\n\n# Tell git to ignore all files that are OS-dependent and don't have useful data.\ngit_vaccinate() \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Set up GitHub Authentication\n\nThe next step is to tell GitHub how to recognize information from your computer, and to associate that computer with your user. \nTo make this process as smooth as possible, we have to configure either HTTPS or SSH authentication. \n\nSSH authentication is slightly more secure (but the reasons are very technical) and can be used for additional ID verification, while HTTPS authentication can be used over some networks which block SSH traffic.\nGitHub's recommendation has apparently changed several times, but as of 2022, it seems that HTTPS is easiest to configure across platforms [@k107AnswerGitClone2022]. \n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n##### SSH\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a ssh key if one doesn't already exist\nif (!file.exists(git2r::ssh_path(\"id_rsa.pub\"))) {\n  # Create an ssh key (with no password - less secure, but simpler)\n  system(\"ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -q -N ''\") \n  # Find the ssh-agent that will keep track of the password\n  system(\"eval $(ssh-agent -s)\")\n  # Add the key\n  system(\"ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\")\n} \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThen, in RStudio, go to Tools > Global Options > Git/SVN. View your public key, and copy it to the clipboard. \n\nThen, proceed to github. Make sure you're signed in. \n\n1. Click on your profile pic in upper right corner -> Settings -> SSH and GPG keys. \n2. Click \"New SSH key\". \n3. Paste your public key in the \"Key\" box. Give it an informative title. For example, you might use 2025-laptop to record the year and computer. \n4. Click \"Add SSH key\".\n\nYou can double-check that everything worked by opening a terminal and running `ssh -T git@github.com`, as described in the [GitHub SSH Authentication documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection). \n\n##### HTTPS\n\n1. In the R console, run:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::create_github_token()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n2. Click \"Generate token\" in the github window that appears.\n\n3. Copy the generated PAT to your clipboard\n\n4. In the R console, run:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nPaste your PAT in response to the console prompt. \n\n:::\n\nWhichever option (HTTPS or SSH) you chose will determine which address you should select when cloning a GitHub repository. \n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n##### SSH\n\n![When you clone a github repository, make sure to select the SSH protocol before copying the web address.](../images/tools/github-ssh-clone.png){fig-alt=\"A screenshot of the github repository for this book.

The PDF generation options are as follows: Weave Rnw files using `knitr`, Typeset LaTeX into PDF using `XeLaTeX` (for font compatibility and modern rendering). The LaTeX editing and compilation options are a set of checkboxes; the two checked options are use tinytex when compiling .tex files, and Clean auxiliary output after compile. The PDF preview options can be set as you desire and are highly operating-system dependent.\"}\n\n\n::::\n\n\n::: diy\n### Try it out! Exploring (and configuring) RStudio {.unnumbered}\n\nOpen RStudio on your computer and explore a bit.\n\n-   Can you find the R console? Type in `2+2` to make sure the result is `4`.\n-   Run the following code in the R console to set up some basic packages:\n\n``` r\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"rmarkdown\", \"knitr\", \"quarto\"))\n```\n\n-   Run the following code in the R console to set up Python:\n\n``` r\ninstall.packages(\"reticulate\")\nreticulate::virtualenv_create(\"stat-python\") # Create a python environment\nreticulate::virtualenv_install(\"stat-python\", c(\"numpy\", \"matplotlib\", \"pandas\"))\n```\n\n-   Configure RStudio to use the python virtual environment you created:\n    -   Go to Tools -> Global Options -> Python\n    -   Click the Python interpreter Select button\n    -   Click Virtual Environments\n    -   Choose `stat-python` and hit \"Select\"\n    -   Restart RStudio when prompted to ensure the setting takes effect.\n\n-   Test out Python:\n    - Go to the Console tab, and click on the R logo. A dropdown should be present with an option to select Python. \n    - Wait for the Python prompt to appear (it will look like this: `>>>`)\n    - Type `2 + 2`, hit enter, and make sure the result is `4`. \n\n-   Can you find the text editor?\n    -   Create a new quarto document (File -\\> New File -\\> Quarto Document).\n    -   Select a blank quarto document (bottom of the pop-up window)\n    -   Change the text editor to Source mode (it will default to visual mode). This makes it possible to paste a quarto document without Visual mode trying to \"fix\" the markup characters. \n    -   Paste in the contents of [this document](../files/getting-started-r-python.qmd).\n    -   Compile the document (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + K) and use the Viewer pane to see the result.\n\n-   If this all worked, you have RStudio, Quarto, R, and Python set up correctly on your machine.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.learnmore collapse=true}\n### Customizing RStudio {-}\n\nIf you prefer dark mode (or other color schemes), you can customize RStudio with different [themes](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/115011846747-Using-Themes-in-the-RStudio-IDE). \n[Github user max-alletsee maintains a repository of a *ton* of different RStudio themes](https://github.com/max-alletsee/rstudio-themes), including some that are colorblind friendly or designed for people with different visual processing constraints. \n\nThere are also [keyboard shortcuts](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts-in-the-RStudio-IDE) and you can set [custom shortcuts](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/productivity/custom-shortcuts.html) as well. \n\nSome people like fonts that use ligatures (multi-block characters). Ligatures can cause e.g. the assignment operator `<-` to look like $\\leftarrow$ in your text editor. If you like this idea, then [you can enable font ligatures by installing Fira Code or another ligature-friendly font and allowing RStudio to use ligatures](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34548194/rstudio-how-to-enable-font-ligatures-in-rstudio). \n:::\n",
