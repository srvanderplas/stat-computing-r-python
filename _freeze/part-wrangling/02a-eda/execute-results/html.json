Much of the\nmaterial in this chapter is based at least in part on the R4DS chapter.\n:::\n\n\n![(Image from https://www.mrdbourke.com) \nThe EDA lifecycle starts with data collection and is\nprimarily a cycle between checking data types, assessing distributions,\nfeature engineering, and model iteration. These tasks are supported by\nsummary statistics, visualization, and\nmodeling.](../images/wrangling/an-EDA-lifecycle.png){fig-align=\"center\"\nwidth=\"75%\"}\n<!-- https://www.mrdbourke.com/content/images/size/w1000/2019/09/an-EDA-lifecycle.png -->\n\nMajor components of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n\n-   generating questions about your data\n-   look for answers to the questions (visualization, transformation,\n    modeling)\n-   use answers to refine the questions and generate new questions\n\nEDA is an iterative process. It is like brainstorming - you start with an idea or question you might have about the data, investigate, and then generate new ideas. \nEDA is useful even when you are relatively familiar with the type of data you're working with: in any dataset, it is good to make sure that you know the quality of the data as well as the relationships between the variables in the dataset.\n\nEDA is important because it helps us to know what challenges a particular data set might bring, what we might do with it. \nReal data is often messy, with large amounts of cleaning that must be done before statistical analysis can commence.\n\nWhile in many classes you'll be given mostly clean data, you do need to know how to clean your own data up so that you can use more interesting data sets for projects (and for fun!). \nEDA is an important component to learning how to work with messy data.\n\n::: .callout-note\nIn this section, I will mostly be using the plot commands that come with\nbase R/python and require no extra packages. The R for Data Science book\n[@r4ds] shows plot commands which use the `ggplot2` library. I'll show\nyou some plots from ggplot here as well, but you don't have to\nunderstand how to generate them yet. We will learn more about ggplot2\nlater, though if you want to start using it now, you may.\n:::\n\n## A Note on Language Philosophies \n\nIt is usually relatively easy to get summary statistics from a dataset, but the \"flow\" of EDA is somewhat different depending on the language patterns.\n\n> You must realize that R is written by experts in statistics and\n> statistical computing who, despite popular opinion, do not believe\n> that everything in SAS and SPSS is worth copying. Some things done in\n> such packages, which trace their roots back to the days of punched\n> cards and magnetic tape when fitting a single linear model may take\n> several days because your first 5 attempts failed due to syntax errors\n> in the JCL or the SAS code, still reflect the approach of \"give me\n> every possible statistic that could be calculated from this model,\n> whether or not it makes sense\". The approach taken in R is different.\n> The underlying assumption is that the useR is thinking about the\n> analysis while doing it. -- Douglas Bates\n\nI provide this as a historical artifact, but it does explain the difference between the approach to EDA and model output in R and Python, and the approach in SAS, which you may see in your other statistics classes. \nThis is not (at least, in my opinion) a criticism -- the SAS philosophy dates back to the mainframe and punch card days, and the syntax and output still bear evidence of that -- but it is worth noting.\n\nIn R and in Python, you will have to specify each piece of output you want, but in SAS you will get more than you ever wanted with a single command. Neither approach is wrong, but sometimes one is preferable over the other for a given problem.\n\n## Generating EDA Questions\n\nI very much like the two quotes in the @r4ds section on EDA Questions:\n\n> There are no routine statistical questions, only questionable\n> statistical routines. --- Sir David Cox\n\n> Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often\n> vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be\n> made precise. --- John Tukey\n\nAs statisticians, we are concerned with variability by default. \nThis is also true during EDA: we are interested in variability (or sometimes, lack thereof) in the variables in our dataset, including the co-variability between multiple variables.\n\nWe may assess variability using pictures or numerical summaries:\n\n-   histograms or density plots (continuous variables)\n-   column plots (categorical variables)\n-   boxplots\n-   5 number summaries (min, 25%, mean, 75%, max)\n-   tabular data summaries (for categorical variables)\n\nIn many cases, this gives us a picture of both variability and the\n\"typical\" value of our variable.\n\nSometimes we may also be interested in identifying unusual values: outliers, data entry errors, and other points which don't conform to our expectations. \nThese unusual values may show up when we generate pictures and the axis limits are much larger than expected.\n\nWe also are usually concerned with missing values - in many cases, not all observations are complete, and this missingness can interfere with statistical analyses. \nIt can be helpful to keep track of how much missingness there is in any particular variable and any patterns of missingness that would impact the eventual data analysis[^exploratory-data-analysis-1].\n\n[^exploratory-data-analysis-1]: One package for this process in R is\n    `naniar` [@tierneyNaniarDataStructures2021].\n\nIf you are having trouble getting started on EDA, @danielbourkeGentleIntroductionExploratory2019 provides a nice checklist to get you thinking:\n\n> 1.  What question(s) are you trying to solve (or prove wrong)?\n> 2.  What kind of data do you have and how do you treat different\n>     types?\n> 3.  What's missing from the data and how do you deal with it?\n> 4.  Where are the outliers and why should you care about them?\n> 5.  How can you add, change or remove features to get more out of your\n>     data?\n\n## Useful EDA Techniques\n\n::: column-margin\n[![Nintendo, Creatures, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons](../images/wrangling/International_Pokemon_logo.png){fig-alt=\"Pokemon logo\"}](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:International_Pok%C3%A9mon_logo.svg\")\n:::\n\n::: callout-caution\n\n### Example: Generations of Pokemon\n\nSuppose we want to explore Pokemon.

values.\n\n#### Categorical Variables\n\nOne useful way to assess the distribution of values is to generate a\ncross-tabular view of the data.
