A visual display can stop your mental flow in its tracks and make you think. A visual display can force you to notice what you never expected to see. (\"Why, that scatter diagram has a hole in the middle!\") -- John W. Tukey [@tukeyDataBasedGraphicsVisual1990]\n\nFundamentally, charts are easier to understand than raw data.\n\nWhen you think about it, data is a pretty artificial thing. \nWe exist in a world of tangible objects, but data are an abstraction - even when the data record information about the tangible world, the measurements are a way of removing the physical and transforming the \"real world\" into a virtual thing. \nAs a result, it can be hard to wrap our heads around what our data contain. \nThe solution to this is to transform our data back into something that is \"tangible\" in some way -- if not physical and literally touch-able, at least something we can view and \"wrap our heads around\".\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n### Thought Experiment\n\nYou have a simple data set - 2 variables, about 150 observations. \nYou want to get a sense of how the variables relate to each other. \nYou can do one of the following options:\n\n1.  Print out the data set\n2.  Create some summary statistics of each variable and perhaps the covariance between the two variables\n3.  Draw a scatter plot of the two variables\n\nWhich one would you rather use?

quickly.\nEvolution is good at optimizing for survival, and it's important to be able to survey a field and pick out the tiger that might eat you. \nWhen we present information visually, in a format that can leverage our visual processing abilities, we offload some of the work of understanding the data to a chart that organizes it for us. \nYou could argue that printing out the data is a visual presentation, but it requires that you read that data in as text, which we're not nearly as equipped to process quickly (and in parallel).\n\nIn addition, it's a lot easier to talk to non-experts about complicated statistics using visualizations.\nMoving the discussion from abstract concepts to concrete shapes and lines keeps people who are potentially already math or stat phobic from

we have to instead create a dictionary of colors for each factor label, and then use the `.map` function to apply our dictionary to our factor variable.\n\nTo create a legend, we define handles and use the dictionary to create the legend. Then we have to manually position the legend in the lower right of the plot.

[Read more about aesthetics](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#aesthetic-mappings)\n\nIn `ggplot2`/`plotnine`, [statistics](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#statistical-transformations) can be used within geoms to summarize data. \nAdditional modifications of plots in `ggplot2` include changing the [coordinate system](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#coordinate-systems), adjusting [positions](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#position-adjustments), and adding subplots using [facets](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#facets). \nNot all of these are fully implemented in `plotnine`, but most features are available in both systems.\n\n\n#### Seaborn\n\nIn seaborn, we can describe plots using three different basic templates:\n\n![Seaborn API module organization. [Source](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/function_overview.html)](../images/wrangling/seaborn-api-plottypes.png)\n\n```\nsns.relplot(data = <DATA>, x = <X var>, y = <Y var>, \n            kind = <PLOT TYPE>, <ADDITIONAL ARGS>)\n\nsns.displot(data = <DATA>, x = <X var>, y = <Y var, optional>, \n            kind = <PLOT TYPE>, <ADDITIONAL ARGS>)\n\nsns.catplot(data = <DATA>, x = <Categorical X var>, y = <Y var>, \n            kind = <PLOT TYPE>, <ADDITIONAL ARGS>)\n\n# General version\nsns.<PLOTTYPE>(data = <DATA>, <MAPPINGS>, \n               kind = <PLOT SUBTYPE>, <ADDITIONAL ARGS>)\n```\n\nHere, the kind argument is somewhat similar to the geom argument in ggplot2, but there are different functions used for different purposes. \nThis seems to be a way to handle statistical transformations without the full grammar-of-graphics implementation of statistics that is found in `ggplot2`. \nRead more about [statistical relationships](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/relational.html), [distributions](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/distributions.html), and [categorical data](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/categorical.html) in the [seaborn tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/introduction.html). \n\n\n\n#### Seaborn Objects\n\nIn Version 0.12, Seaborn introduced a new interface, the [objects interface](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/objects_interface.html#), that is much more grammar-of-graphics like than the default Seaborn interface.\n\nWe can come up with a generic plot template that looks something like this:\n\n```\n(\n  so.Plot(<DATA>, <MAPPINGS>, <GROUPS>)\n  .add(so.<GEOM>(<ARGS>), so.<TRANSFORMATION>, so.<POSITION>)\n  .show()\n)\n```\n\n#### R base\n\nR's base graphics library is decidedly non-grammar-of-graphics like. Each plot is defined using plot-specific arguments that are not particularly consistent across different functions.\n\nThe following is as close as I can get, but it's still not accurate for many plots.\n```\n<PLOT NAME>(<MAPPINGS>, <ARGS>)\n<LEGEND>(<MAPPINGS>, <ARGS>)\n```\nAny statistics are either computed as part of the plot function (e.g. `hist()`) or there are plot methods to accompany the statistic calculation (`plot(density(...))`). \nFacets/subplots are sometimes created using `par(mfrow=(...))` to define sub-plots, and are sometimes created by the plot command itself, in the case of e.g. passing a numeric matrix to `plot()`, which creates a scatterplot matrix.\n\nUseful commands: `plot()` for scatterplots, lines (type = 'l'), scatterplot matrices, etc. `hist()` for histograms. `plot(density(...))` for density plots. `boxplot()` for boxplots, `barplot()` for bar plots, ...\n\n#### Matplotlib\n\nI'm not even going to try to create a grammar summary for matplotlib... there just isn't one. It wasn't designed with the grammar of graphics in mind, and was built by computer scientists [@koehrsenNextLevelData2019], not statisticians. \nAs a result, even retrofitting some sort of \"grammar\" interpretation doesn't work so well.\n\nFor a primer on matplotlib, I recommend [@mckinneyPythonDataAnalysis2022, Ch 9]. \n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Advanced: Charts, Graphics, and the Grammar of Graphics\n\nThere are two general approaches to generating statistical graphics computationally: \n  \n1. Manually specify the plot that you want, possibly doing the preprocessing and summarizing before you create the plot.    \nBase R, matplotlib, old-style SAS graphics\n\n2. Describe the relationship between the plot and the data, using sensible defaults that can be customized for common operations.    \nggplot2, plotnine, seaborn (sort of), seaborn objects\n\n\n::: column-margin\nThere is a difference between *low-level* plotting libraries (base R, matplotlib) and *high-level* plotting libraries (ggplot2, plotnine, seaborn). \nGrammar of graphics libraries are usually high level, but it is entirely possible to have a high level library that does not follow the grammar of graphics. \nIn general, if you have to manually add a legend, it's probably a low level library.\n:::\n\nIn the introduction to The Grammar of Graphics [@wilkinsonGrammarGraphics1999], Leland Wilkinson suggests that the first approach is what we would call \"charts\" - pie charts, line charts, bar charts - objects that are \"instances of much more general objects\". \nHis argument is that elegant graphical design means we have to think about an underlying theory of graphics, rather than how to create specific charts. \nThe 2nd approach is called the \"grammar of graphics\". \n\n::: column-margin\nThere are other graphics systems (namely, `lattice` in R, `seaborn` in Python, and some web-based rendering engines like `Observable` or `d3`) that you could explore, but it's far more important that you know how to functionally create plots in R and/or Python. \nI don't recommend you try to become proficient in all of them. \n**Pick one (two at most) and get familiar with those libraries, then google for the rest.**\n:::\n\nBefore we delve into the grammar of graphics, let's motivate the philosophy using a simple task.\nSuppose we want to create a pie chart using some data. \nPie charts are terrible, and we've known it for 100 years[@croxtonBarChartsCircle1927a], so in the interests of showing that we know that pie charts are awful, we'll also create a stacked bar chart, which is the most commonly promoted alternative to a pie chart. \nWe'll talk about what makes pie charts terrible at the end of this module in [Creating Good charts](@sec-good-graphics).\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=true}\n### Example: Generations of Pokemon\n\n::: column-margin\n[![Nintendo, Creatures, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons](../images/wrangling/International_Pokemon_logo.png){fig-alt=\"Pokemon logo\"}](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/International_Pok%C3%A9mon_logo.svg\")\n:::\n\nSuppose we want to explore Pokemon.

understanding helps the analyst to know where to apply the tools and what to look out for.\n\nTukey claims that while tools are constantly evolving, and there may not be one set of \"best\" tools, understanding is a bit different. \nThere are situational elements -- you might need different base knowledge to solve a crime in a small village in the UK than you need to solve a crime in New York City or Buenos Aires. \nHowever, the broad strokes of what questions are asked during an investigation will be similar across different  locations and types of crimes. \n\nThe same thing is true in exploratory data analysis - while it is helpful to have a basic understanding of the dataset, and being intimately familiar with the type of data and data collection processes can give the analyst an advantage, the same basic detective skills will be useful across a wide variety of data sets.\n\nThere is one other aspect of the analogy between EDA and detective work that is useful: the detective gathers evidence, but does not try the case or make decisions about what should happen to the accused.\nSimilarly, the individual conducting an exploratory data analysis should not move too quickly to hypothesis testing and other confirmatory data analysis techniques.\nIn exploratory data analysis, the goal is to lay the foundation, assess the evidence (data) for interesting clues, and to try to understand the whole story. \nOnly once this process is complete should we move to any sort of confirmatory analysis.\n\nIn this section, we'll primarily use charts as a tool for exploratory data analysis.\nPay close attention not only to the tools, but to the process of inquiry.\n\n### Texas Housing Data\n\nLet's explore the `txhousing` data a bit more thoroughly by adding some complexity to our chart. \nThis example will give me an opportunity to show you how an exploratory data analysis might work in practice, while also demonstrating some of the features of each plotting library.\n\n\n### Starting Chart\n\nBefore we start exploring, let's start with a basic scatterplot, and add a title and label our axes, so that we're creating good, informative charts.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### Sketch\n\n![A Sketch of the mapping between a data frame and a scatterplot, showing the geoms, aesthetics, transformations, scales, coordinate systems, and statistics that are created by default.](../images/wrangling/grammar-graphics-dataset-mapping.png)\n\n\n#### ggplot2 {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = txhousing, aes(x = date, y = median)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  xlab(\"Date\") + ylab(\"Median Home Price\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Texas Housing Prices\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](02b-graphics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-5.png){width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### plotnine {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nggplot(txhousing, aes(x = \"date\", y = \"median\")) +\\\ngeom_point() +\\\nxlab(\"Date\") + ylab(\"Median Home Price\") +\\\nggtitle(\"Texas Housing Prices\")\n## <Figure Size: (640 x 480)>\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](02b-graphics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png){width=614}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Seaborn\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n(\n  so.Plot(txhousing, x = \"date\", y = \"median\")\n  .add(so.Dot(alpha = 0.1))\n  .label(x = \"Date\", y = \"Median Home Price\", title = \"Texas Housing Prices\")\n  .show()\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](02b-graphics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-3.png){width=614}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n### Exploring Trends\n\nFirst, we may want to show some sort of overall trend line. \nWe can start with a linear regression, but it may be better to use a loess smooth ([loess regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression) is a fancy weighted average and can create curves without too much additional effort on your part).\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### Sketch\n\n![A Sketch of the mapping between a data frame and a scatterplot, showing the geoms, aesthetics, transformations, scales, coordinate systems, and statistics that are created by default.

The jury is still very much out on whether log transformations make data easier to read and understand\n\n\n\n## What type of chart to use?\n\nIt can be hard to know what type of chart to use for a particular type of data. \nI recommend figuring out what you want to show first, and then thinking about how to show that data with an appropriate plot type. \n\nConsider the following factors:\n\n-   What type of variable is x? Categorical? Continuous? Discrete?\n\n-   What type of variable is y?\n\n-   How many observations do I have for each x/y variable?\n\n-   Are there any important moderating variables?\n\n-   Do I have data that might be best shown in small multiples? E.g. a categorical moderating variable and a lot of data, where the categorical variable might be important for showing different features of the data?\n\nOnce you've thought through this, take a look through catalogs like the [R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/) or the  [Python Graph Gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com/) to see what visualizations match your data and use-case.\n\n@sec-good-graphics talks in more depth about considerations for creating *good* charts; these considerations may also inform your decisions.\n\n::: {.callout-learnmore}\n\n## Additional Reading \n\n### R graphics {.unnumbered}\n\n-   [ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)\n-   [ggplot2 aesthetics cheat sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dvul1p6TYH6gWJzZRwpE0YX1dO0hDF-b/view) - aesthetic mapping one page cheatsheet\n-   [ggplot2 reference guide](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/)\n-   [R graph cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/)\n-   [Data Visualization in R](https://ramnathv.github.io/pycon2014-r/visualize/base_graphics.html) (\\@ramnathv)\n\n### Python graphics {.unnumbered}\n\n-   [Plotnine documentation](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n-   [Matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/) - Matplotlib is the base that plotnine uses to replicate ggplot2 functionality\n    -   [Visualization with Matplotlib](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/ch04.html) chapter of Python Data Science\n-   [Scientific Visualization with Python](https://github.com/rougier/scientific-visualization-book/blob/master/pdf/book.pdf)\n\n:::\n\n## References  {#sec-graphics-b-refs}\n",
