To do this, you should be master the following concepts:\n\n-   Determine what data format is necessary to generate a desired plot or statistical model\n-   Understand the differences between \"wide\" and \"long\" format data and how to transition between the two structures\n\n## Tidy and Messy Data\n\n### Motivating Example\n\nConsider the spreadsheet screenshot in @fig-human-readable.\n\n![Spreadsheet intended for human consumption, from @mccallumBadDataHandbook2013 (Chapter 3)](../images/wrangling/Data-human-consumption.png){#fig-human-readable}\n\nThis spreadsheet shows New Zealand High School certificate achievement levels for a boys-only school. \nTypically, students would get level 1 in year 11, level 2 in year 12, and level 3 in year 13, but it is possible for students to gain multiple levels in a single year. \nThis data is organized to show the number of students gaining each type of certification (broken out by gender) across each of the 3 years. \nThere are many blank cells that provide ample space to see the data, and all of the necessary variables are represented: there are essentially three 2x3 tables showing the number of students attaining each NCEA level in each year of school. \nIf all of the information is present in this table, is there really a problem? \nPerhaps not if the goal is just to display the data, but analyzing this data effectively, or plotting it in a way that is useful, requires some restructuring.\n@fig-machine-readable shows a restructured version of this data in a more compact rectangular format.\n\n![Spreadsheet reorganized for data analysis](../images/wrangling/Data-machine-consumption.png){#fig-machine-readable}\n\nIn @fig-machine-readable, each column contains one variable: Year, gender, level, and total number of students. Each row contains one observation. \nWe still have 18 data points, but this format is optimized for statistical analysis, rather than to display for (human) visual consumption. \nWe will refer to this restructured data as \"tidy\" data: it has a single column for each variable and a single row for each observation.\n\n### Defining Tidy data\n\nThe illustrations below are lifted from an [excellent blog post](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2020/10/12/tidy-data/) [@lowndesTidyDataEfficiency2020] about tidy data; they're reproduced here because\n\n1.  they're beautiful and licensed as CCA-4.0-by, and\n2.  they might be more memorable than the equivalent paragraphs of text without illustration.\n\nMost of the time, data does not come in a format suitable for analysis. \nSpreadsheets are generally optimized for data entry or viewing, rather than for statistical analysis:\n\n-   Tables may be laid out for easy data entry, so that there are multiple observations in a single row\n-   It may be visually preferable to arrange columns of data to show multiple times or categories on the same row for easy comparison\n\nWhen we analyze data, however, we care much more about the fundamental structure of observations: discrete units of data collection. \nEach observation may have several corresponding variables that may be measured simultaneously, but fundamentally each discrete data point is what we are interested in analyzing.\n\nThe structure of **tidy data** reflects this preference for keeping the data in a fundamental form: each observation is in its own row, any observed variables are in single columns. \nThis format is inherently rectangular, which is also important for statistical analysis - our methods are typically designed to work with matrices of data.\n\n![Tidy data format, illustrated.](../images/wrangling/tidydata_1.jpg){#fig-tidy-data-definition fig-alt=\"Stylized text providing an overview of Tidy Data. The top reads “Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. - Hadley Wickham.” On the left reads “In tidy data: each variable forms a column; each observation forms a row; each cell is a single measurement.” There is an example table on the lower right with columns ‘id’, ‘name’ and ‘color’ with observations for different cats, illustrating tidy data structure.\"}\n\n![An illustration of the principle that every messy dataset is messy in its own way.](../images/wrangling/tidydata_2.jpg){fig-alt=\"There are two sets of anthropomorphized data tables. The top group of three tables are all rectangular and smiling, with a shared speech bubble reading “our columns are variables and our rows are observations!”. Text to the left of that group reads “The standard structure of tidy data means that “tidy datasets are all alike…” The lower group of four tables are all different shapes, look ragged and concerned, and have different speech bubbles reading (from left to right) “my column are values and my rows are variables”, “I have variables in columns AND in rows”, “I have multiple variables in a single column”, and “I don’t even KNOW what my deal is.” Next to the frazzled data tables is text “...but every messy dataset is messy in its own way. -Hadley Wickham.”\"}\n\nThe preference for tidy data has several practical implications: it is easier to reuse code on tidy data, allowing for analysis using a standardized set of tools (rather than having to build a custom tool for each data analysis job).\n\n![Tidy data is easier to manage because the same tools and approaches apply to multiple datasets.](../images/wrangling/tidydata_3.jpg){fig-alt=\"On the left is a happy cute fuzzy monster holding a rectangular data frame with a tool that fits the data frame shape. On the workbench behind the monster are other data frames of similar rectangular shape, and neatly arranged tools that also look like they would fit those data frames. The workbench looks uncluttered and tidy. The text above the tidy workbench reads “When working with tidy data, we can use the same tools in similar ways for different datasets…” On the right is a cute monster looking very frustrated, using duct tape and other tools to haphazardly tie data tables together, each in a different way. The monster is in front of a messy, cluttered workbench. The text above the frustrated monster reads “...but working with untidy data often means reinventing the wheel with one-time approaches that are hard to iterate or reuse.”\"}\n\nIn addition, standardized tools for data analysis means that it is easier to collaborate with others: if everyone starts with the same set of assumptions about the data set, you can borrow methods and tools from a collaborator's analysis and easily apply them to your own data set.\n\n::: {#fig-tidy-data-advantages layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n![Collaboration with tidy data.](../images/wrangling/tidydata_4.jpg){fig-alt=\"Two happy looking round fuzzy monsters, each holding a similarly shaped wrench with the word “wrangle” on it.

(see above, where `-country` excludes country from the pivot operation)\n\nWhich option is easier depends how many things you're pivoting (and how the columns are structured).\n\nIf we wanted to avoid the table join, we could do this process another way: first, we would add a column to each tibble called id with values \"cases\" and \"population\" respectively. \nThen, we could bind the two tables together by row (so stack them on top of each other).\nWe could then do a wide-to-long pivot, followed by a long-to-wide pivot to get our data into tidy form.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create ID columns\ntable4a.x <- table4a %>% mutate(id = \"cases\")\ntable4b.x <- table4b %>% mutate(id = \"population\")\n# Create one table\ntable4 <- bind_rows(table4a.x, table4b.x)\n\ntable4_long <- table4 %>%\n  # rearrange columns\n  select(country, id, `1999`, `2000`) %>%\n  # Don't pivot country or id\n  pivot_longer(-c(country:id), names_to = \"year\", values_to = \"count\")\n\n# Intermediate fully-long form\ntable4_long\n## # A tibble: 12 × 4\n##    country     id         year       count\n##    <chr>       <chr>      <chr>      <dbl>\n##  1 Afghanistan cases      1999         745\n##  2 Afghanistan cases      2000        2666\n##  3 Brazil      cases      1999       37737\n##  4 Brazil      cases      2000       80488\n##  5 China       cases      1999      212258\n##  6 China       cases      2000      213766\n##  7 Afghanistan population 1999    19987071\n##  8 Afghanistan population 2000    20595360\n##  9 Brazil      population 1999   172006362\n## 10 Brazil      population 2000   174504898\n## 11 China       population 1999  1272915272\n## 12 China       population 2000  1280428583\n\n# make wider, with case and population columns\ntable4_tidy <- table4_long %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = id, values_from = count)\n\ntable4_tidy\n## # A tibble: 6 × 4\n##   country     year   cases population\n##   <chr>       <chr>  <dbl>      <dbl>\n## 1 Afghanistan 1999     745   19987071\n## 2 Afghanistan 2000    2666   20595360\n## 3 Brazil      1999   37737  172006362\n## 4 Brazil      2000   80488  174504898\n## 5 China       1999  212258 1272915272\n## 6 China       2000  213766 1280428583\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Python\n\nIn Pandas, `pandas.melt(...)` takes `id_vars`, `value_vars`, `var_name`, and `value_name`. \nOtherwise, it functions nearly exactly the same as `pivot_longer`;
