C, Pascal, Fortran, and UNIX shells are naturally procedural. JavaScript is also a fairly natural procedural language. Many R analysis scripts are also naturally written in a procedural style; SAS code is almost always procedural.\n- **Declarative languages** use code to describe the problem that needs to be solved, and the language figures out how to solve it. SQL is the most common declarative language you'll encounter for data-related tasks.\n- **Object oriented** languages (sometimes abbreviated OOP, for object-oriented programming) manipulate collections of objects or classes. Data is stored in classes that have associated functions, which are often called methods. Java is explicitly object-oriented; C++ and Python support object-oriented programming but don't force you to use those features.\n- **Functional** programming languages describe a problem using a set of functions, which only take inputs and produce outputs. Functions don't have any internal tracking of **state** - purely functional languages move from input to output without storing variables or even printing output to the command line, but it is common to adopt a functional approach to programming without requiring strict adherence to all principles of a fully functional approach. Haskell and Rust are fairly standard functional programming languages.\n\n\n::: {.youtube-video-container .aside}\nHadley's talk on The Joy of Functional Programming for Data Science\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzUmK0Y07ck\" title=\"&quot;The Joy of Functional Programming (for Data Science)&quot; with Hadley Wickham\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n:::\n\n\nFunctional programming languages have a goal of writing **pure functions** - functions that do not change the global state (stuff stored in objects, memory, parameters, or files) of the program and thus have no side effects. \nThe return value of a pure function is based solely on the inputs to the function.\nNot all functions can be pure functions - for instance, there's no pure way to do file IO operations. \nBut it is a nice goal to be able to move parameters into functions and have the correct object returned from that function, so that you can pipe multiple operations together into a pipeline.\n\nMost general-purpose languages like C++ and Python and even some domain languages like R support multiple different programming paradigms. \nWhile preparing to write this chapter, I saw functional programming books with examples in Java [@urmaModernJavaAction2018], JavaScript [@FPJS], and C# [@buonannoFunctionalProgrammingHow2017] - all languages that I would associate with OOP or procedural styles.\nI also found books teaching object oriented programming using Fortran 90-95 [@OOPfortran], which is something I wouldn't have considered possible.\n\nAll of this is to say that while certain languages are built around principles like OOP or functional programming, almost every language has users who rely more heavily on one approach than the other. \nThere are very few \"pure\" programming languages, which reminds me of one of my favorite quotes about English: \n\n> \"The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We don't just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.\" ― [James D. Nicoll](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/694108-the-problem-with-defending-the-purity-of-the-english-language)\n\n::: callout-demo\n### Object Oriented Philosophy in R and Python\n::: panel-tabset\n#### Python\n\nWhen you call `df.size()` in Python, you are calling the `size` method that is part of the `df` object, which is a `DataFrame`. \nThis suggests that Pandas, at least, is programmed using an object-oriented paradigm. \n\n#### R\n\n<!-- R is a bit of a trickier case.  -->\n<!-- R has several different types of object-oriented structures that we usually avoid talking about until you start looking at developing your own R packages.  -->\n<!-- R also was designed by people who enjoyed using Lisp - another multi-paradigm approach that accommodates functional programming, procedural programming, and object-oriented programming.  -->\nAn easy example of R's object oriented nature is that when you fit different models or perform different tests, the default output is different. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(mtcars)\n\nr1 <- t.test(mtcars$mpg~mtcars$vs)\nprint(r1)\n## \n## \tWelch Two Sample t-test\n## \n## data:  mtcars$mpg by mtcars$vs\n## t = -4.6671, df = 22.716, p-value = 0.0001098\n## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0\n## 95 percent confidence interval:\n##  -11.462508  -4.418445\n## sample estimates:\n## mean in group 0 mean in group 1 \n##        16.61667        24.55714\n\nr2 <- lm(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$vs)\nprint(r2)\n## \n## Call:\n## lm(formula = mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$vs)\n## \n## Coefficients:\n## (Intercept)    mtcars$vs  \n##       16.62         7.94\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe output is different because each test/regression model object has a different print method, which allows R to create different output for each type of object. \n\n:::\n\n:::\n\nFunctional programming allows us to write programs that are more modular, and thus, are easier to test and debug.\nIn addition, functional programming encourages you to think about data **pipelines**: a sequence of steps that are reproducible and reusable for different data sets and analyses.\nFunctional programming is convenient for another (more esoteric, but important) reason - it allows you to prove that a function or series of functions is actually correct (rather than just testing input/output combinations). \n\n![A pipeline of functional data analysis. Each function (station) modifies the data in some way and the returned result is passed into the next function (station) as input. This allows a sequence of functions to format data, visualize it, model it, and then package the results. While this paradigm doesn't require a functional approach, functional programming does make it simpler. Modified from [Allison Horst's work](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)](../images/wrangling/functional-pipeline.png){fig-alt=\"Cute fuzzy monsters putting rectangular data tables onto a conveyor belt. Along the conveyor belt line are different automated “stations” that update the data. A monster at the end of the conveyor belt is carrying away a table that reads “Complete analysis.”\"}\n\nIf you have been using the R pipe (`|>` or `%>%`), you didn't realize it, but you were already using functional programming. Piping results from one function to another in a chain is a prime example of the \"pure function\" idea - it allows us to chain each step of a sequence together to create a sequence that is modular and testable.\n\n::: callout-demo\n\n### A simple Functional Example\n\nA **functional** is a function that takes another function as input and returns a vector as output.\n\nOne simple example of a functional that is found in both R and Python is the `apply` function (or variants in R like `lapply`, `sapply`, `tapply`). \nIn Python, `.apply` is a method in Pandas, but we can find an even more low-level equivalent in the ideas of **list comprehensions** and **map** functions. \n\nOne additional concept that is helpful before we start is the idea of a **lambda** function - a small anonymous function (that is, a function that is not  named or stored in a variable).\nLambda functions are great for filling in default arguments, but they have many other uses as well.\n\nCan you identify the lambda functions in each of the following examples?\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n#### R\n\nThis code generates 5 draws from a normal random variable with the specified mean and standard deviation 1.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlapply(1:5, function(x) rnorm(5, mean = x, sd = 1))\n## [[1]]\n## [1] 1.3587496 0.1578278 1.8249207 1.0645067 1.9241987\n## \n## [[2]]\n## [1] 1.344622 1.932193 1.093726 1.625325 2.571887\n## \n## [[3]]\n## [1] 2.6920844 3.3576957 2.6263409 0.8166047 2.2277849\n## \n## [[4]]\n## [1] 2.907850 3.526292 5.091808 5.156028 4.981953\n## \n## [[5]]\n## [1] 4.643083 5.200319 4.238091 5.128817 4.894213\n```\n:::\n\n\nOr, if you have R 4.1.0 or above, you can use a shorthand version:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlapply(1:5, \\(x) rnorm(5, mean = x))\n## [[1]]\n## [1]  2.8012549 -0.2346510  0.3769987  1.7063192  2.1886159\n## \n## [[2]]\n## [1] 2.270315 1.451908 1.448878 2.702576 2.465227\n## \n## [[3]]\n## [1] 4.500227 2.211936 2.558935 3.997856 4.267816\n## \n## [[4]]\n## [1] 3.204811 5.952805 5.375644 3.557751 5.113919\n## \n## [[5]]\n## [1] 4.578079 5.617726 3.328408 7.213570 5.017305\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `\\(x)` is shorthand for `function(x)` and allows you to quickly and easily define anonymous functions in R.\n\n\n#### Python\n\nThis code generates 5 draws from a normal random variable with the specified mean and standard deviation 1.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\n\n# List comprehension approach\nr1 = [np.random.normal(i, size = 5) for i in range(1, 6)]\nprint(r1) \n\n# Functional approach\n# Defining a lambda function allows us to fill in non-default options\n## [array([ 1.76476401,  1.35267653, -1.09449081,  2.16596692, -0.91875791]), array([1.80168433, 1.50543587, 1.82256708, 1.55480133, 0.41157027]), array([1.82099044, 3.18914168, 3.33961501, 1.73248254, 2.27343437]), array([2.59610875, 2.42921154, 3.66834034, 5.86745926, 3.70872423]), array([5.33108396, 5.2239654 , 5.09992483, 6.09193623, 5.14104148])]\nr2 = map(lambda a: np.random.normal(a, size = 5), range(1, 6))\n\n# This is what map spits out by default\nprint(r2)\n# get your results back out with list()\n## <map object at 0x7fe50cefc910>\nr2b = list(r2) \nprint(r2b)\n## [array([0.51129768, 1.08162385, 1.88433886, 0.89460784, 0.20396103]), array([2.07040278, 2.34700046, 1.04725466, 1.27830775, 3.30674721]), array([3.0215988 , 3.03822637, 2.46045834, 2.68475217, 3.38659899]), array([3.16271049, 4.76917786, 4.47538028, 4.97590086, 4.3004413 ]), array([3.76597878, 4.52098374, 3.62290811, 3.70206799, 5.00095883])]\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Replacing Loops with Functional Programming\n\nOne really convenient application of functional programming is to replace loops. \nAs Hadley Wickham says in [-@advr], \n\n> the real downside of for loops is that they’re very flexible: a loop conveys that you’re iterating, but not what should be done with the results\n\nThat is, in many cases when programming with data, what we want is to iterate over a vector and return a vector of results. \nThis is a *perfect* use case for functional programming, since we're specifying both that we're iterating AND more explicitly collecting the results into a form that makes sense.\n\nIf we work with this definition of functional programming, then python list comprehensions are also a functional approach: they specify how the results are collected (usually by putting `[]` around the statement) and how the iteration will occur @rituraj_jainNestedListComprehensions2018.\n\n::: aside\nThere is an excellent vignette comparing Base R functional programming approaches to the `purrr` package that is worth a look if you've used one and want to try the other [@hadleywickhamPurrrBase2022].\n:::\n\nLet's look at a few examples.\n\n::: callout-demo\nSuppose we want to look at the Lego data and create a decade variable that describes the decade a set was first released.\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### base R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlego <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/datasets/main/clean/lego_sets.csv\")\n\nlego$decade <- sapply(lego$year, \\(x) floor(x/10)*10)\nhead(lego[,c(\"set_num\", \"name\", \"year\", \"decade\")])\n##   set_num                       name year decade\n## 1   001-1                      Gears 1965   1960\n## 2  0011-2          Town Mini-Figures 1979   1970\n## 3  0011-3 Castle 2 for 1 Bonus Offer 1987   1980\n## 4  0012-1         Space Mini-Figures 1979   1970\n## 5  0013-1         Space Mini-Figures 1979   1970\n## 6  0014-1         Space Mini-Figures 1979   1970\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nStrictly speaking, this use of `sapply` isn't necessary - because R is vectorized by default, we could also have used `lego$decade <- floor(lego$year/10)*10`.\nHowever, there are functions in R that are not fully vectorized, and it is useful to know this approach for those use-cases as well, and it's easier to demonstrate this approach with a relatively simple use case.\n\n### R: `purrr`\n\nIn purrr, you can create anonymous functions using `~` with `.` as a placeholder.

We \"unnest\" the summary information, which is equivalent to bringing the columns we defined up to the primary level and binding the rows together.\n\nAt each step, we're specifying the form of the results along with the contents.\n\n\n#### Python\n\nThis construct of storing everything inside a single data frame isn't as common in Python, but we can make it work with only a little extra effort. \n\nYou will need to `pip install statsmodels` to get the `statsmodels` [@seabold2010statsmodels] package that implements many basic statistical models. \nThe `scikit-learn` package [@scikitlearn] is another commonly used package [@menonLinearRegressionLines2018], but it does not have the easy accessor functions to pull out e.g. coefficients and r-squared values, so we'll use `statsmodels` here. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom statsmodels.formula.api import ols\n\n# Create a function to fit a linear regression\n# There is probably a better way to do this flexibly,\n# but this approach is simple and useful for illustrative purposes\ndef pokereg(data):\n  x = data[[\"hp\"]].values\n  y = data[[\"total\"]].values\n  model = ols('total ~ hp', data)\n  results = model.fit()\n  return results\n\nres = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/datasets/main/clean/pokemon_gen_1-9.csv\")\n\n# Replace NAs with \"\"\nres[\"variant\"] = [\"\" if pd.isna(i) else i for i in res.variant]\n# Remove mega pokemon\nres = res.query('~(variant.str.contains(\"(?:^[mM]ega)\"))')\n\n# Group data frames and apply regression function to each group\nres_reg = (\n  res # step 1\n    .groupby(\"gen\") # step 2\n    .apply(pokereg) # step 3\n)\n\n# Make results into a dataframe and rename the column as 'results'\nres_reg = pd.DataFrame(res_reg).rename(columns = {0:'results'}) # step 4\n\n# Get values of interest and store in new columns # step 5\nres_reg = res_reg.reset_index() # store gen in its own column\nres_reg['coef1'] = res_reg.results.map(lambda x: x.params[0])\nres_reg['coef2'] = res_reg.results.map(lambda x: x.params[1])\nres_reg['rsq'] = res_reg.results.map(lambda x: x.rsquared)\n\nres_reg[['gen', 'coef1', 'coef2', 'rsq']]\n##    gen       coef1     coef2       rsq\n## 0    1  262.472956  2.394032  0.389526\n## 1    2  258.581538  2.133868  0.316529\n## 2    3  245.337496  2.753912  0.268681\n## 3    4  268.579237  2.792350  0.350019\n## 4    5  189.133898  3.506458  0.557880\n## 5    6  252.743437  2.798942  0.527816\n## 6    7  234.932868  3.293730  0.438289\n## 7    8  205.272637  3.500811  0.604222\n## 8    9  236.865627  2.757408  0.475703\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhile this doesn't store our data in the same DataFrame as the model results, we do have a key that links the two: the `gen` variable is present in both `res` and `res_reg` and can be used to join the data to the regression results, if necessary.\n\n1. Data in an ungrouped data frame\n2. We group by `gen` (generation)\n3. We apply the function `pokereg` to fit a linear regression, and the results are stored in an indexed Series where the index corresponds to `gen`.\n4. We make the results into a DataFrame so that we can add extra columns, and rename the automatically created Series to `results` to be more descriptive\n5. We create summary information and store the summaries in columns in the data frame.\n\nWhile the grouping and binding operations are in a different order in Python than in R, the basic specification of the structure of the output each time we iterate is similar.\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.youtube-video-container .aside}\nHere's another demonstration of the use of the `tidymodels` package and `purrr` to fit multiple regression models to data subsets.\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KdDyRt9XV_g\" title=\"Nested data frames and multiple models in R with Equitable Equations\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n:::\n\n\n## Complex Data Structures\n\nNot all datasets are strictly tabular. \nOne of the most common situations where we get data that can't be made into a completely tabular structure is when we're dealing with hierarchical data: tree structures, (network) graph structures, and even most webpages contain data that isn't strictly tabular in nature.\nSometimes, we can get that data into a tabular structure, but it generally depends on the data itself.\n\nOne of the most common structures for storing data on the web is [JSON: JavaScript Object Notation](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)[@wikipediacontributorsJSON2023]. \n\n::: aside\n(JSON is pronounced \"Jason\", like the person's name).\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n![The Movie Database](../images/wrangling/tmdb.svg){fig-alt=\"The Movie Database logo\" width=\"50%\"}\nIn this section we'll work with some data gathered from TMDB (the movie database). \nI submitted a query for all movies that Patrick Stewart was involved with, and you can find the resulting JSON file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/stat-computing-r-python/main/data/Patrick_Stewart.json). \n\n::: callout-demo\n\n### JSON File Parsing\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n#### R\n\nWe'll use the `jsonlite` package to read the data in, but invariably this package still requires us to do some post-processing ourselves.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(jsonlite)\ndata_url <- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/stat-computing-r-python/main/data/Patrick_Stewart.json\"\n\nps_json <- fromJSON(data_url)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n<details><summary>Exploring the output structure</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# head(ps_json) # This output is too long\nmap(ps_json, head) # show the first 6 rows of each element in the list\n## $cast\n##   adult                    backdrop_path       genre_ids    id\n## 1 FALSE /mNdsbVuRdsyo8eitW2IBW2BWRkU.jpg 878, 28, 12, 53   193\n## 2 FALSE /wygUDDRNpeKUnkekRGeLCZM93tA.jpg 878, 28, 12, 53   199\n## 3 FALSE /vsjuHP9RQZJgYUvvSlO3mjJpXkq.jpg 878, 28, 12, 53   200\n## 4 FALSE /6z9w8eidKWDDXwZNSVNaRolAYEP.jpg 878, 28, 12, 53   201\n## 5 FALSE /4ADZ2iiATjoKxZwjJRiEo1x6Fk0.jpg              99 10946\n## 6 FALSE                             <NA>              99 21746\n##   original_language              original_title\n## 1                en      Star Trek: Generations\n## 2                en    Star Trek: First Contact\n## 3                en     Star Trek: Insurrection\n## 4                en          Star Trek: Nemesis\n## 5                en                       Earth\n## 6                en The Secret of Life on Earth\n##                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                overview\n## 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the Enterprise-D find themselves at odds with the renegade scientist Soran who is destroying entire star systems.

Especially as there's a ghost and a mysterious re-appearing bloodstain on the hearth. She campaigns to go back home, and her dad, believing the ghost's pranks are Ginny's, is ready to send her back. But then Ginny actually meets the elusive 17th-century Sir Simon de Canterville (not to mention the cute teenaged duke next door), and she sets her hand to the task of freeing Sir Simon from his curse.\n## 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In this re-imagining of Shakespear's King Lear, Patrick Stewart stars as John Lear, a Texas cattle baron, who, after dividing his wealth among his three daughters, is rejected by them.\n## 5 King Henry II (Patrick Stewart) keeps his wife, Eleanor (Glenn Close) locked away in the towers because of her frequent attempts to overthrow him. With Eleanor out of the way he can have his dalliances with his young mistress (Yuliya Vysotskaya). Needless to say the queen is not pleased, although she still has affection for the king. Working through her sons, she plots the king's demise and the rise of her second and preferred son, Richard (Andrew Howard), to the throne. The youngest son, John (Rafe Spall), an overweight buffoon and the only son holding his father's affection is the king's choice after the death of his first son, young Henry. But John is also overly eager for power and is willing to plot his father's demise with middle brother, Geoffrey (John Light) and the young king of France, Phillip (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). Geoffrey, of course sees his younger brother's weakness and sees that route as his path to power. Obviously political and court intrigue ensues\n## 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Scrooge is a miserly old businessman in 1840s London.

They were first developed in the early 1900â\\u0080\\u0099s. This cross produces offspring that are very good layers throughout the year and lay a very light brown to off white egg shell color egg. The Austra White pullet will be white with little black specks in some feathers. This cross is considered to be a heavier breed and their disposition is calmer than the pure Leghorn chicken breed. There are many benefits to raising baby chickens from this cross. These hens will lay a lot of large eggs; have good feed to egg production ratios and good for chickens for backyards. Raising chickens for eggs at home can be fun and relaxing. Free range chicken eggs are great tasting eggs and this hybrid chicken breed has good reflexes for predator avoidance, however, they are white and easily seen.\\nWe also offer at limited times of the year Austra White Fertile Hatching Eggs\n## 2                                    The breed originated from the island of Java, Indonesia and has probably been used for centuries in religious and mystical purposes. The breed was first described by Dutch colonial settlers and first imported to Europe in 1998 by Dutch breeder Jan Steverink. Their beak and tongue, comb and wattles, even their meat bones and organs appear black. The blood of the Ayam Cemani is normally colored. The birdâ\\u0080\\u0099s black color occurs as a result of excess pigmentation of the tissues, caused by a genetic condition known as fibro melanosis. This gene is also found in some other black fowl breeds. Roosters can get some mulberry upon maturity due to testosterone and other influences. The hens lay cream-colored eggs, although they are poor setters and rarely hatch their own brood. Our Ayam Cemaniâ\\u0080\\u0099s bloodline includes Raven and some Greenfire.\\n30% will have white color leakages in tongue, mouth and toes.\\nWe cannot guarantee the distribution of black pigment on chicks.\\nWe now have Ayam Cemani Fertile Hatching Eggs for sale click here!\n## 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The Barnevelder chicken originates from the Barneveld region of Holland and known for laying a dark brown egg. This beautiful bird has a single comb, is hardy and quiet and doesnâ\\u0080\\u0099t mind being confined. The breed was first recognized by the American Standard of Perfection in 1991.

Hen, Good, Thank You, Austra Duds, Got my Chicks!, Nice birds!, Wonderful Chicks, Motherâ\\u0080\\u0099s day surprise , Good, Like this bird, Good Hens, Adventurous birds! , Not your ordinary personalities, BEST\\n, Yum! We used to get , Cackle Hatchery, Cackle Hatchery, Testimonal, Cackle Hatchery, Cackle Hatchery, Very happy to see my 25 hens get here on time. All of them seem, so far happy and healthy., Purchased Austra White pullet last year. I LOOOVE her, she went broody late summer, hatched 2 eggs (which I had ordered) such a good Mommy bird.  Henny Penny is very friendly, she lets me pick her up and she comes running to me when I walk out the door.  She is a precious bird!, Want to say two years later they are great birds hardy and great free rangers. 5 eggs a week from my birds. Will get this breed again. , Got my chicks, all alive and doing well. I had 2 setters and they adopted them as their own. So precious. Thank you, a very pleased customer., I ordered a handful of these last spring and have to admit I am disappointed with them. When they do lay the eggs are super large and a beautiful cream color but mine do not lay often. Two of them are broody every couple months and never seem to lay and the other two only give me eggs once in awhile. My Easter Eggers, Ameraucanas, and Welsummers are by far better layers., Got my baby chicks this morning! All healthy, all doing fantastic! The tracking for my package was spot on with much appreciated detail. I got my chicks shipped to Hawaii which has additional fees and you have to have a higher minimum of birds and it was totally 100% worth it. I will be using your service in the future and will be recommending it to others. Thank you so very much!, I have 3 of these pullets and at about 21 weeks they are just starting to lay.  They are large, handsome and very friendly birds. As youngsters they were always flying up on my shoulders and are very adventurous.  Their eggs are still smallish and are light cream in color.  Iâ\\u0080\\u0099m very happy with them., I received 4 Austra White pullets as part of an order of 16 chicks on March 1st and they have made beautiful hens.  One began laying at 16 weeks of age which is the earliest I have ever heard of.  I would highly recommend this breed and Cackle Hatchery as this flock of hens that also contains 4 Buff Orpingtons, 3 Turkens, 3 Cuckoo Marans and 2 Black Golden Laced Wyandottes is the nicest flock I have ever had in my 50+ years of raising chickens., I ordered 15 chicks at the end of November 2016.  10 EEâ\\u0080\\u0099s and 5\\n Austra Whites.  All 5 of the Whites survived, but I lost 5 EE in January.  The white chicks were more aggrisive then my Easter eggers and separated them for a month until bigger.  I kept them in a large brooder box in an enclosed porch area with an electric chicken heater until April. The whites were very hungry chicks.  Iâ\\u0080\\u0099ve never had a leg horn breed type before.  They are certainly more assertive than my Easter egger, RIR,  and Cinnamon Queens (they lay large to jumbo eggs, but are kind of dumb birds).  Today, Motherâ\\u0080\\u0099s Day, one of my Austra Whites layed a small pretty cream egg!  Looking forward to seeing how big  and how many they  can lay., Good, Love this bird.  Not as skittish or as flighty as many suggest.  One was bullied by a Black Sex Link however I solved the issue by removing the Black Sex Link for three days and now everything is fine.  Lay some of the biggest eggs Iâ\\u0080\\u0099ve ever seen.  Two within the last two weeks measuring 3â\\u0080³ X 2â\\u0080³ (thatâ\\u0080\\u0099s big my friend).  Friendly at times and will eat from my hand., Received chicks in the middle of March and as they age have become more friendly.  Guess it takes time for them to trust humans.  Anyhow they have been consistent layers and one bird in particular has layed two eggs over the last month that measured 3â\\u0080³ X 2â\\u0080³.  Now they are humongeous eggs.  The Austra Whites share a coop with Red and Black Sex link hens are all are doing fine., We ordered 6 Austra Whites and received 7 on time and in excellent, healthy condition. We gave them water with electrolytes right away, and they were so much fun to handle as tiny chicks. They are now about 5 months old and we still have all 7. They havenâ\\u0080\\u0099t started laying yet, but they are very adventurous and have been from the time they were baby chicks. They were the first of all 5 breeds we have to fly out of the trough we kept the babies in, they were the first to scale our fence, they were the first to find their way onto the roof of our house, and they are the only breed we have that will wander far from the house (which kinda worries us because we have had hawks get a couple other breeds, and Austra Whites areâ\\u0080¦wellâ\\u0080¦white.) They definitely keep us on our toes! , Out of 4:  One was very mean at one month, pecking all her siblings so I had to get rid of her.  Another one escaped three weeks ago and never was seen again.  Another is an escape artists and ALWAYS climbs up over the chicken wire.  I have one ordinary one.  Phew!  This breed keeps me hopping., I am now on week number 2 with the 22 Chicks Cackle has sent me. They are all very healthy and beautiful birds. They are growing very nice and canâ\\u0080\\u0099t wait for them to be able to move to the Big coop so they can roam around freely. More orders to come for sure. Friendly FAST Service for sure. Already made a pre-order for some Buff Orpingtons. Can not wait to get them., Yum! We used to get green eggs all the time but my green egg layers have been on strkie lately so all we have now is rose and brown ð\\u009f\\u0099\\u0082 I Love green eggs!, Just wanted to tell you that we received our chicks midday on the 17th..and all were perfectly perfect and adorable! Thanks soooooo much for working with us on a quicker ship date:), They all arrived yesterday in great health and lots of vigor. By far the best order we have ever received from any hatchery. Thanks, Last year I purchased a dozen chickens six barred rocks and six Austra Whites. i am pleased with them. All of these girls are healthy and ornery at a year old. They are just now at nearly a year old starting to lay eggs. All of the eggs i have found have been quite large, surprising for pullets. They are all loaded with personality. With the exception of a few chickens I obtained from neighbors and friends, at least 3/4 of my flock came from Cackle Hatchery. Even the mixed breeds that I hatched out indirectly came from your hatchery since the parent birds were hatched in your facility. We have 23 chickens in all and I am always getting compliments on how good they look, as well as how friendly they are. I just wanted to say thank you for these fine quality birds that I get to enjoy having around. Thank you, Just a quick thank you. Once again your company delivered a box full of live healthy and vibrant chickens. All arrived doing fine. We ordered 60 and weâ\\u0080\\u0099re not disappointed with the chicks in the least. Thanks to Cackle sending a few more chicks for warmth than we ordered.\\nWe ordered Egyptian for the first time. They are the most active chicks I have ever seen. The special heavy assorted was a great bargain. The chicks were even marked as requested!!!. You have earned my business once again. I have shared your catalog with friends and relatives and will continue to do so. Thanks again and keep up the excellent service., I received my chicks today and found all but 1 made it alive not bad odds for ordering 70 chicks.

Beautiful Birds, Chicken order, Thank You, Iâ\\u0080\\u0099ve ordered from you guys twice now and I have not lost one chick. In the two orders you sent extra girls for warmth I think 7 all together bonus! Beautiful birds my barnevelders just started laying large dark speckled eggs. They have great personalities I highly recommend this breed., My 4 Barnevelders are 3 weeks old. Theyâ\\u0080\\u0099ve arrived in 24 hours to Atlanta, in great health. They seem to grow by the second, but weâ\\u0080\\u0099ve had no problems since their arrival. They are beutiful, full of personality, friendly and well behaved. Im very happy. Thank you. I will try to post a follow ip when they are older., I purchased my chicks in Sept of 2016.  Everyone of them were healthy and lived.  I purchased a combination of Sussex and Wyandotteâ\\u0080\\u0099s.  They were all hand raised and are very friendly and love to â\\u0080\\u009ctalkâ\\u0080\\u009d to you.  We had no issues with health or poop and they have grown into beautiful, large birds, and produce plenty of eggs.  We will definitely buy from you again when we are ready to expand our flock., I just wanted to send you some feedback on an order you sent me. They arrived all healthy and are doing great!!! My wife and I wanted to thank you for the way you handled the order and the quality of the chicks you sent us., Iâ\\u0080\\u0099m just wanting to express my thanks to you for the five different breeds of chicks that I got from your hatchery Feb 12th. They are doing quite well, one or two of the chicks has a soft poop but still seem to be full of energy. Being I never experienced chicks before, I was really surprised at how fast they grow. On the fifth day I had to extend my wall of the brooding area because they would jump and or fly over my twelve inch high pen. I did lose one of the barred rocks around the third or fourth day. I actually expected to lose two or three but I am blessed to have lost only one. Thanks for good service, information and kindly taking the time to answer my many questions.\n## 4

birds, Beautiful, sweet birds / consistent layers, review, Beautiful chickens and fun pets !, Not my favs, Cackle Hatchery, We had a great year , These birds are awesome . They are lively from the start unlike to golden laced cochins. The show type bred into these birds is incredible. I have 6 pullets and 3 cockerels that could stand lots of competition. They are also heavy egg layers. So very impressed with them. They should be priced at double the cost!, We brought in barred cochin bantams last spring, and with thoughtful, gentle interaction, they have grown up to be beautiful, friendly, personable birds with very sweet personalities. I have many breeds in my flock, all with their own charm, but I do think these two Barred Cochins are perhaps the sweetest, cuddliest birds Iâ\\u0080\\u0099ve ever had.  Highly recommend for a gentle flock. (We have Polish, Silkies, Seramas, Brahmas, Wyandottes, Ameraucanas.) These birds arenâ\\u0080\\u0099t bullies and would not do well with super aggressive flockmates., nice breed doing well, We absolutely love our Barred Cochin Bantams!  I bought them for my children to raise as beloved pets.  They are so beautiful and sweet tempered.  They love to be held and fed worms.  , We bought a few different kinds of bantams and these were definitely my least favorite. One died in transit, one died two days after we got them, one was a rooster, and one is a nice little pullet. We bought sexed females. All-in-all I like the one that we ended up with, but did not like how sickly the rooster and the one that died were. Our other bantams that we received, golden laced Cochin, Rhode island red, and barred Rock, have all been healthy and seem much stronger., Just wanted you to know how pleased I am with my chickens from your company. They arrived in great health and have grown into these beauties. Many Thanks!, We had a great year at county fair.  This was our fifth year doing 4-H, but our first year being on the hoetaemsd with 4-H.  We have done static (the cooking, rockets, sewing, etc) exhibits before and last year we took 3 meat goats, but we had to keep them a t a friends house for 2 months prior to fair.  Last year se moved to a rental house 1 week before fair and didnâ\\u0080\\u0099t get our statics turned in.  So this year, now that we have a few acres we got a little carried away and took 38 statics   between 3 kids, and we took 3 dairy goats, 5 meat goats, 3 sheep, 6 chickens and 1 rabbit. Whoo!  that was probably a bit much!  We had a great time and the kids received 100 ribbons, plaques and awards in 4-H and our family got another 15 in open class.  We tried a lot of new things and the kids were pleased that for our first year in poultry they got either champion or reserve in showmanship.  We found out we donâ\\u0080\\u0099t like sheep, and we like the chickens more than we thought we would.  We love 4-H and will be incorporating 4-H projects into our homeschool so that most of the projects are done by June and we donâ\\u0080\\u0099t have the summer scramble to finish and then we can just concentrate on the livestock.\n## 5

He is very protective of his hens but at the same time, he is very nice and gentle and likes to be held by humans. Great bred for first time chicken owners or if you live in cold areas like colorado , Our chickens arrived in excellent condition and have all been incredibly healthy.  The are now 6 months old and absolutely beautiful. I get compliments on how pretty my cochins are all the time.  I highly recommend buying all your chickens from Cacklehatchery.com!!! , Ordered Barred Cochins. I love these birds. Big, sturdy birds that are beautiful, fully feathered down to their feet, and so sweet. Hands down my favorite breed!, Just wanted to say that the Standard Golden Laced Cochins and the Standard Barred Cochins I ordered and received back in April are looking just beautiful! Very beautiful chickens, with great feathering! I am pleased with both breeds, and am especially excited about the standard sized Barred Cochins because it was only when I saw them on your list of cochins did I realize that the Barred even existed in the standard size!

I ordered 30 chicks and received 57. They are beautiful! Also I want to thank you for offering a discount to 4-Hers! I really appreciate it. I will be showing my birds at the fair this year. You folks also have AWESOME customer service, so keep up the good work!
