# Simulation and Reproducibility {#simulation}

## {{< fa bullseye >}} Objectives

-   Program a simulation for a specific task, process, or model
-   Understand the limitaitons of pseudorandom number generation

Simulation is an extremely important part of computational statistics.
Bayesian statistics, in particular, relies on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to get results from even the most basic of models.
In this module, we're going to touch on a few foundational pieces of simulation in computing, and you will get more exposure to simulation-based methods in other courses down the line.

## Pseudorandom Number Generation

Computers are almost entirely deterministic, which makes it very difficult to come up with "random" numbers.
In addition to the deterministic nature of computing, it's also somewhat important to be able to run the same code and get the same results every time, which isn't possible if you rely on truly random numbers.

Historically, **pseudorandom** numbers were generated using linear congruential generators (LCGs) [@wikipediacontributorsLinearCongruentialGenerator2022].
These algorithms aren't typically used anymore, but they provide a good demonstration of how one might go about generating numbers that seem "random" but are actually deterministic.
LCGs use modular arithmetic: $$X_{n+1} = (aX_n + c) \mod m$$ where $X_0$ is the start value (the seed), $a$ is the multiplier, $c$ is the increment, and $m$ is the modulus.
When using a LCG, the user generally specifies only the seed.

![LCGs generate numbers which at first appear random, but once sufficiently many numbers have been generated, it is clear that there is some structure in the data. (Image from Wikimedia)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Lcg_3d.gif){fig-align="center"}

The important thing to note here is that if you specify the same generator values ($a$, $c$, $m$, and $X_0$), you will always get the same series of numbers.
Since $a$, $c$, $m$ are usually specified by the implementation, as a user, you should expect that if you specify the same seed, you will get the same results, every time.

::: callout-warning
It is critically important to set your seed if you want the results to be reproducible and you are using an algorithm that depends on randomness.
:::

Once you set your seed, the remaining results will only be reproducible if you generate the same set of random numbers every time.

::: column-margin
I once helped a friend fit a model for their masters thesis using Simulated Annealing (which relies on random seeds).
We got brilliant results, but couldn't ever reproduce them, because I hadn't set the seed first and we never could figure out what the original seed was.

### Example: Setting Seeds for Reproducibility

:::: panel-tabset
#### R

```{r}
set.seed(342512)

# Get 10 numbers after the seed is set
sample(1:100, 10)

# Compute something else that depends on randomness
mean(rnorm(50))

# Get 10 more numbers
sample(1:100, 10)
```

#### Python

```{python}
import random
import numpy as np

# Create a random generator with a specific seed
rng = np.random.default_rng(342512)

# Generate 10 integers
rng.integers(low = 1, high = 100, size = 10)

# Generate 500 std normal draws and take the mean
np.mean(rng.standard_normal(500))

# Get 10 more numbers
rng.integers(low = 1, high = 100, size = 10)
```

::::

Compare the results above to these results:

:::: panel-tabset
#### R
```{r}
set.seed(342512)

# Get 10 numbers after the seed is set
sample(1:100, 10)

# Compute something else that depends on randomness
mean(rnorm(30))

# Get 10 more numbers
sample(1:100, 10)
```

#### Python
```{python}
import random
import numpy as np

# Create a random generator with a specific seed
rng = np.random.default_rng(342512)

# Generate 10 integers
rng.integers(low = 1, high = 100, size = 10)

# Generate 30 std normal draws and take the mean
np.mean(rng.standard_normal(30))

# Get 10 more numbers
rng.integers(low = 1, high = 100, size = 10)
```

::::

Notice how the results have changed?
:::

To make my documents more reproducible, I will sometimes set a new seed at the start of an important chunk, even if I've already set the seed earlier.
This introduces certain "fixed points" where results won't change immediately after I've re-set the seed.
This is particularly important when I'm generating bootstrap estimates, fitting models, or simulating data for graphics experiments.

Pick your seed in any way you want.
I tend to just randomly wiggle my fingers over the number keys, but I have also heard of people using the date in yyyymmdd format, favorite people's birthdays, the current time in hhmmss format... basically, you can use anything.

## Built-in simulations from distributions

Often, we can get away with just simulating data from a known distribution.
As both R and python are meant for statistical computing, this is extremely easy by design.

::: panel-tabset
### R

You can see the various distribution options using `?Distributions`.
In general, `dxxx` is the PDF/PMF, `pxxx` is the CDF, `qxxx` is the quantile function, and `rxxx` gives you random nubmers generated from the distribution.
(`xxx`, obviously, is whatever distribution you're looking to use.)

## Simulation to test model assumptions

One of the more powerful ways to use simulation in practice is to use it to test the assumptions of your model.
Suppose, for instance, that your data are highly skewed, but you want to use a method that assumes normally distributed errors.
How bad will your results be?
Where can you trust the results, and where should you be cautious?

::: column-margin
The `purrr::map` notation specifies that we're using the `map` function from the `purrr` package.
When functions are named generically, and there may be more than one package with a function name, it is often more readable to specify the package name along with the function.

`purrr::map` takes an argument and for each "group" calls the compute_interval function, storing the results in `res`.
So each row in `res` is a 1x2 tibble with columns lb and ub.

This pattern is very useful in all sorts of applications.
You can read more about purrr in @sec-lists.

### Example: Confidence Interval coverage rates

::: panel-tabset
#### Problem

Suppose, for instance, that we have a lognormal distribution (highly skewed) and we want to compute a 95% confidence interval for the mean of our 25 observations.

You want to assess the coverage probability of a confidence interval computed under two different modeling scenarios:

1.  Working with the log-transformed values, ln(x), and then transform the computed interval back
2.  Working with the raw values, x, compute an interval assuming the data are symmetric, essentially treating the lognormal distribution as if it were normal.

**Scenario 1**:

- the expected value of the standard normal deviates is 0
- the variance of the data is 1
- the SE($\overline x$) is $\sqrt\frac{1}{25} = \frac{1}{5}$

Our theoretical interval should be $(\exp(-1.96/5), \exp(1.96/5)) = (`r sprintf("%0.4f", exp(-1.96/5))`, `r sprintf("%0.4f",  exp(1.96/5))`)$.

**Scenario 2**

- The expected value of the lognormal distribution is $\exp(1/2) = `r exp(.5)`$
- The variance of the data is $(\exp(1) - 1)(\exp(1)) = `r (exp(1) - 1)*exp(1)`$ 
- The SE($\overline x$) is thus $\sqrt{\frac{(e^1 - 1)e^1}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{(e^1 - 1)e^1}}{5} = `r sprintf("%.04f", sqrt((exp(1) - 1)*exp(1))/5)`$

Our theoretical interval should be $(`r sprintf("%0.4f", exp(.5) - 1.96*sqrt((exp(1) - 1)*exp(1))/5)`, `r sprintf("%0.4f", exp(.5) + 1.96*sqrt((exp(1) - 1)*exp(1))/5)`)$.
This interval could, if the circumstances were slightly different, contain 0, which is implausible for lognormally distributed data.

Our expected values are different under scenario 1 and scenario 2: 

- In scenario 1 we are computing an interval for $\mu$
- In scenario 2, we are computing an interval for the population mean, which is $\exp(\mu + .5\sigma^2)$

Both are valid quantities we might be interested in, but they do not mean the same thing.


#### Simulate Data

```{r}
set.seed(40295023)

sim <- tibble(
  id = rep(1:100, each = 25), # generate 100 samples of 25 points each
  ln_x = rnorm(25*100), # generate 25 normal deviates for each sample
  x = exp(ln_x), # transform into lognormal deviates
) %>%
  # this creates a 100-row data frame, with one row for each id. 
  # the columns x, ln_x are stored in the data list-column as a tibble.
  nest(data = c(x, ln_x))
  
head(sim)
sim$data[[1]]
```

```{r, include = F}
options(digits = 3)
```

#### Function

```{r}
compute_interval <- function(x) {
  s1 <- exp(mean(log(x)) + c(-1, 1) * qnorm(.975) * sd(log(x))/sqrt(length(x)))
  s2 <- mean(x) + c(-1, 1) * qnorm(.975) * sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))
  tibble(scenario = c("scenario_1", "scenario_2"),
         mean = c(1, exp(1/2)),
         lb = c(s1[1], s2[1]), ub = c(s1[2], s2[2]),
         in_interval = (lb < mean) & (ub > mean))
}
```

#### Apply to Data
```{r}

sim_long <- sim %>%
  # This line takes each data entry and computes an interval for x.
  # .$x is code for take the argument you passed in to map and get the x column
  mutate(res = purrr::map(data, ~compute_interval(.$x))) %>%
  # this "frees" res and we end up with two columns: lb and ub, for each scenario
  unnest(res)
  

ci_df <- tibble(scenario = c("scenario_1", "scenario_2"),
                mu = c(1, exp(1/2)),
                lb = c(exp(-1.96/5), exp(.5) - 1.96*sqrt((exp(1) - 1)*exp(1))/5),
                ub = c(exp(1.96/5), exp(.5) + 1.96*sqrt((exp(1) - 1)*exp(1))/5))

```

#### Results
```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = lb, xmax = ub, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf), 
            data = ci_df,
            fill = "grey", alpha = .5, color = NA) + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mu), data = ci_df) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = lb, xend = ub, y = id, yend = id, color = in_interval),
               data = sim_long) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "black")) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  facet_wrap(~scenario)
```
:::

From this, we can see that working with the log-transformed, normally distributed results has better coverage probability than working with the raw data and computing the population mean: the estimates in the latter procedure have lower coverage probability, and many of the intervals are much wider than necessary; in some cases, the interval actually lies outside of the domain.

This example talks about how to take a biased sample and then recover the original unbiased estimates -- which is something you have to test using simulation to be sure it works, because you never actually know what the true population features are when you are working with real world data.
When reading this example, you may not be all that interested with the specific model - but focus on the **process of simulating data for your analysis** so that you understand how and why you would want to simulate data in order to test a computational method.

### Example: Regression and high-leverage points

What happens if we have one high-leverage point (e.g. a point which is an outlier in both x and y)?
How pathological do our regression coefficient estimates get?

The challenging part here is to design a data generating mechanism.

::: panel-tabset
#### Data Generation
```{r}
gen_data <- function(o = 1, n = 30, error_sd = 2) {
  # generate the main part of the regression data
  data <- tibble(x = rnorm(n = n - o, 
                           mean = seq(-10, 10, length.out = n - o), 
                           sd = .1),
                 y = x + rnorm(length(x), 
                               mean = 0, 
                               sd = error_sd))
  # generate the outlier - make it at ~(-10, 5)
  outdata <- tibble(x = rnorm(o, -10), y = rnorm(o, 5, error_sd))
  bind_rows(data, outdata)
}

sim_data <- crossing(id = 1:100, outliers = 0:2) %>%
  mutate(
  # call gen_data for each row in sim_data, 
  # but don't use id as a parameter.
  data = purrr::map(outliers, gen_data) 
)

```

#### Data Checking

```{r}
head(sim_data)

# plot a few datasets just to check they look like we expect:
sim_data %>%
  filter(id %% 100 < 3) %>%
  unnest(data) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(id ~ outliers, labeller = label_both)

```

#### Model Fitting
```{r}
library(broom) # the broom package cleans up model objects to tidy form

sim_data <- sim_data %>%
  # fit linear regression
  mutate(model = purrr::map(data, ~lm(y ~ x, data = .)))  %>%
  mutate(tidy_model = purrr::map(model, tidy))
```

#### Results
```{r}
# Get the coefficients out
tidy_coefs <- select(sim_data, id, outliers, tidy_model) %>%
  unnest(tidy_model) %>%
  mutate(group = case_when(outliers == 0 ~ "No HLPs",
                           outliers == 1 ~ "1 HLP",
                           outliers == 2 ~ "2 HLPs") %>%
           factor(levels = c("No HLPs", "1 HLP", "2 HLPs")))

ggplot(tidy_coefs, aes(x = estimate, color = group)) + 
  facet_grid(term ~ .) + 
  geom_density()
```

:::

Obviously, you should experiment with different methods of generating a high-leverage point (maybe use a different distribution?) but this generating mechanism is simple enough for our purposes and shows that the addition of high leverage points biases the true values (slope = 1, intercept = 0).

### Try it out

:::: panel-tabset
#### Problem

Let's explore what happens to estimates when certain observations are censored.

Suppose we have a poorly-designed digital thermometer which cannot detect temperatures above 102$^\circ F$; for these temperatures, the thermometer will record a value of 102.0.

It is estimated that normal body temperature for dogs and cats is 101 to 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit, and values above 104 degrees F are indicative of illness.
Given that you have this poorly calibrated thermometer, design a simulation which estimates the average temperature your thermometer would record for a sample of 100 dogs or cats, and determine the magnitude of the effect of the thermometer's censoring. 

#### Hint

If most pets have a normal body temperature between 101 and 102.5 degrees, can you use these bounds to determine appropriate parameters for a normal distribution?
What if you assume that 101 and 102.5 are the 2SD bounds?

#### General Solution

If 101 and 102.5 are the anchor points we have, let's assume that 95% of normal pet temperatures fall in that range.
So our average temperature would be 101.75, and our standard deviation would be .75/2 = 0.375.

We can simulate 1000 observations from $N(101.75, 0.375)$, create a new variable which truncates them at 102, and compute the mean of both variables to determine just how biased our results are.

#### R Code

```{r}
set.seed(204209527)
dogtemp <- tibble(
  actual = rnorm(1000, 101.75, 0.375),
  read = pmin(actual, 102)
) 
dogtemp %>%
  summarize_all(mean) %>%
  diff()

```

The effect of the thermometer's censoring is around 0.06 degrees F for animals that are not ill.

#### Python Code

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import random

random.seed(204209527)
dogtemp = pd.DataFrame({
  "actual": np.random.normal(size = 1000, loc = 101.75, scale = 0.375)
})
dogtemp['read'] = np.minimum(dogtemp.actual, 102)

np.diff(dogtemp.mean())
```

The effect of the thermometer's censoring is around 0.06 degrees F for animals that are not ill.

## Monte Carlo methods

[Monte carlo methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) [@MonteCarloMethod2022] are methods which rely on repeated random sampling in order to solve numerical problems.
Often, the types of problems approached with MC methods are extremely difficult or impossible to solve analytically.

In general, a MC problem involves these steps:

1.  Define the input domain
2.  Generate inputs randomly from an appropriate probability distribution
3.  Perform a computation using those inputs
4.  Aggregate the results.

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
### Example: Sum of Uniform Random Variables

::: panel-tabset
#### Problem

Let's try it out by using MC simulation to estimate the number of uniform (0,1) random variables needed for the sum to exceed 1.

More precisely, if $u_i \sim U(0,1)$, where \sum\_{i=1}\^k u_i \> 1, what is the expected value of $k$?

#### Defining Steps

1.  In this simulation, our input domain is \[0,1\].
2.  Our input is $u_i \sim U(0,1)$
3.  We generate new $u_i$ until $\sum_{i=1}^k > 1$ and save the value of $k$
4.  We average the result of $N$ such simulations.

#### R Code

```{r, include = F}
options(digits = 8)
```

```{r}
# It's easier to think through the code if we write it inefficiently first
sim_fcn <- function() {
  usum <- 0
  k <- 0
  # prevent infinite loops by monitoring the value of k as well
  while (usum < 1 & k < 15) {
    usum <- runif(1) + usum
    k <- k + 1
  }
  return(k)
}

set.seed(302497852)
res <- tibble(k = replicate(1000, sim_fcn(), simplify = T))

mean(res$k)
```

If we want to see whether the result converges to something, we can increase the number of trials we run:

```{r, cache = T}
set.seed(20417023)

sim_res <- tibble(samp = replicate(250000, sim_fcn(), simplify = T)) 

sim_res <- sim_res %>%
  mutate(running_avg_est = cummean(samp),
         N = row_number())

ggplot(aes(x = N, y = running_avg_est), data = sim_res) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = exp(1), color = "red") + 
  geom_line()
```

#### Python Code

```{python}
import numpy as np
import random
import pandas as pd


def sim_fcn():
  usum = 0
  k = 0
  # prevent infinite loops by monitoring the value of k as well
  while usum < 1 and k < 15:
    # print("k = ", k)
    usum = np.random.uniform(size=1) + usum
    k += 1
  return k

random.seed(302497852)
res = pd.DataFrame({"k": [sim_fcn() for _ in range(1000)]})
```

If we want to see whether the result converges to something, we can increase the number of trials we run:

```{python, cache = T}
random.seed(20417023)

sim_res = pd.DataFrame({"k": [sim_fcn() for _ in range(250000)]})
sim_res['running_avg_est'] = sim_res.k.expanding().mean()
sim_res['N'] = np.arange(len(sim_res))

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.clf()

graph = sns.lineplot(data = sim_res, x = 'N', y = 'running_avg_est', color = "black")
graph.axhline(y = np.exp(1), xmin = 0, xmax = 1, color = "red")

Monte Carlo methods are often used to approximate the value of integrals which do not have a closed-form (in particular, these integrals tend to pop up frequently in Bayesian methods).

### Example: Integration

::: panel-tabset
#### Problem

Suppose you want to integrate $$\int_0^1 x^2 \sin \left(\frac{1}{x}\right) dx$$

```{r, echo = F}
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 4
#| out-width: 50%
#| fig-cap: "f(x) over the interval [0,1]."
#| fig-alt: "A function that oscillates around 0 very rapidly from 0 to 0.12 and then reaches a minimum at approximately x = 0.25 before increasing at an approximately linear rate through x = 1.0."
fn <- function(x) x^2 * sin(1/x)
ggplot(data.frame(x = seq(0.0001, 1, length.out = 1000)), aes(x)) + geom_function(fun = fn)
```

You could set up Riemann integration and evaluate the integral using a sum over $K$ points, but that approach only converges for smooth functions (and besides, that's boring Calc 2 stuff, right?).

Instead, let's observe that this is equivalent to $\int_0^1 x^2 \sin \left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \cdot 1 dx$, where $p(x) = 1$ for a uniform random variable.
That is, this integral can be written as the expected value of the function over the interval $[0,1]$.
What if we just generate a bunch of uniform(0,1) variables, evaluate the value of the function at those points, and average the result?

You can use the law of large numbers to prove that this approach will converge. [@chenLectureMonteCarlo2017]

#### Problem

Let's say that you want to find an estimate for $\pi$, and you know that a circle with radius 1 has an area of exactly that. You also know, that all of the points on this circle can be written as $x^2 + y^2 \le 1$. 

```{r, echo = F}
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 4
#| out-width: 50%
#| fig-cap: "The unit circle."
#| fig-alt: "A circle centered in (0,0) with radius 1."
fn <- function(x) sqrt(1-x^2)
ggplot(data.frame(x = seq(-1, 1, length.out = 1000)), aes(x)) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(y = fn(x)), fill = "grey70", alpha = 0.8) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(y = -fn(x)), fill = "grey70", alpha = 0.8) + 
  geom_path(aes(x = sin(theta), y = cos(theta)), 
            data = data.frame(theta=seq(0,2*pi, by = 0.0001))) + ylab("y")
  
```

Evaluating the area of the circle mathematically, would need us to either change to polar-coordinates or separate the graph into suitable functions (half-circles), and evaluate the integral between the top and the bottom:
$$
\int_{-1}^1 2 \sqrt{1-x^2} dx
$$
Instead, we note that the circle is encapsulated in a square with side length 2. We can reach all points in that square by using two independent uniform random random variables over the interval $[-1,1]$, i.e. when we generate two random values from U[-1,1], and use one as the $x$ coordinate and one as the $y$ coordinate, we get a point in the square. 
If the sum of the squares of the coordinates are less than 1, the point will also fall inside the circle. If not, the point falls in one of the four corners of the square that are outside the circle.

```{r, echo = F}
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 4
#| out-width: 50%
#| fig-cap: "The unit circle  is encapsulated by a square and overlaid with uniform points from U[-1,1] x U[-1,1]. "
#| fig-alt: "A circle centered in (0,0) with radius 1 overlaid with randomly generated points. The points inside the circle are drawn in a different color from the ones outside the circle."

R <- 1000

random <- data.frame(
  x = runif(R, min=-1, max=1),
  y = runif(R, min=-1, max=1)) %>% 
  mutate(
    in_circle = x^2+y^2<1
  )

fn <- function(x) sqrt(1-x^2)
ggplot(data.frame(x = seq(-1, 1, length.out = 1000)), aes(x)) + 
  geom_path(aes(x = x, y = y), data = data.frame(x = c(-1, 1, 1, -1, -1), y = c( 1, 1, -1, -1, 1))) +
  geom_polygon(aes(y = fn(x)), fill = "grey70", alpha = 0.8) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(y = -fn(x)), fill = "grey70", alpha = 0.8) + 
  geom_path(aes(x = sin(theta), y = cos(theta)), 
            data = data.frame(theta=seq(0,2*pi, by = 0.0001))) + ylab("y") + 
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, colour = in_circle), data = random) + 
  coord_equal()
  
```

How do we get to an estimate of $\pi$ from there? We know that the area of the square is simply $2^2 = 4$. The area of the circle is then directly proportional to the rate at which points fall into the circle, ie. 

$$
\hat{\pi} = 4 \times \frac{\text{Number of points with } x^2+y^2 \le 1}{\text{Number of points generated}}.
$$
The more points we generate, the closer our estimate will be to the real value. 



This problem is an example for Monte-Carlo Integration using an Acceptance-Rejection approach: we can slightly re-write the simulation and think of the generation of a new point in the circle as a two step process, where we first generate a value for $x$ from U[-1,1], and in second step generate a candidate $c$ for $y$ from U[-1, 1], which we will only accept as $y$, if  $|c| \le \sqrt{1-x^2}$.  Acceptance-Rejection sampling is the basis of a lot of [Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) (MCMC) methods, such as e.g. the [Metropolis-Hastings algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm).

#### Problem

Buffon's needle is a mathematical problem which can be boiled down to a simple physical simulation.
Read [this science friday description of the problem](https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/estimate-pi-by-dropping-sticks/) and develop a monte carlo simulation method which estimates $\pi$ using the Buffon's needle method.
Your method should be a function which

-   allows the user to specify how many sticks are dropped
-   plots the result of the physical simulation
-   prints out a numerical estimate of pi.

#### R code

Let's start out with horizontal lines at 0 and 1, and set our stick length to 1.
We need to randomly generate a position (of one end of the stick) and an angle.
The position in $x$ doesn't actually make much of a difference (since what we care about is the $y$ coordinates), but we can draw a picture if we generate $x$ as well.

```{r}
needle_sim <- function(sticks = 100) {
  df <- tibble(xstart = runif(sticks, 0, 10), 
         ystart = runif(sticks, 0, 1), 
         angle = runif(sticks, 0, 360),
         xend = xstart + cos(angle/180*pi), 
         yend = ystart + sin(angle/180*pi)
  ) %>%
    # We can see if a stick crosses a line if the floor() function of ystart is 
    # different than floor(yend). 
    # Note this only works for integer line values.
  mutate(crosses_line = floor(ystart) != floor(yend)) 
  
  
  gg <- ggplot() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(0, 1)) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = xstart, y = ystart, xend = xend, yend = yend,
                   color = crosses_line), data = df) + 
  coord_fixed()
  
  return(list(est = 2 * sticks / sum(df$crosses_line), plot = gg))
}

needle_sim(10)

needle_sim(100)

needle_sim(1000)

needle_sim(10000)
```

#### Python Code

```{python}
def needle_sim(sticks = 100):
  df = pd.DataFrame({
    "xstart": np.random.uniform(0, 10, size = sticks),
    "ystart": np.random.uniform(0, 1, size = sticks),
    "angle": np.random.uniform(0, 360, size = sticks)
  })
  
  df['xend'] = df.xstart + np.cos(df.angle/180*np.pi)
  df['yend'] = df.ystart + np.sin(df.angle/180*np.pi)
  df['crosses_line'] = np.floor(df.ystart) != np.floor(df.yend)
  
  return df

data = needle_sim(100000)
data['N'] = np.arange(len(data)) + 1
data['cum_est'] = 2*data.N / data.crosses_line.expanding().sum()


import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.clf()

graph = sns.lineplot(data = data, x = "N", y = "cum_est", color = "black")
graph.axhline(y = np.pi, xmin = 0, xmax = 1, color = "red")
plt.show()
```
