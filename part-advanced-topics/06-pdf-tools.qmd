# Working with PDFs {#sec-pdf-data}

When I started my first job out of graduate school, one particular process used by my coworkers completely mystified me: they would print out a document, and then immediately scan it back in, with the scan emailed to themselves.
This seemed like a waste of toner, paper, and time to me -- why would anyone do such a thing?
Eventually, I found out that the printer would automatically recognize the text and add a text layer to a PDF that previously couldn't be highlighted. 
So, my coworkers found a handy workaround to manually typing out the numbers they needed from older PDF documents!
As clever as this was, it was also unnecessary. A lot of paper, toner, and time could have been saved if the company had just provided **Optical Character Recognition** programs and made them available to workers. 

In this chapter, you'll learn about PDF document structure, as well as how to use OCR programs.

## Objectives {-}

- Identify the type of PDF and the data it contains.
- Develop a strategy to extract the data from the PDF programmatically, using strategies to improve the success of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) if necessary.
- Augment the PDF files with OCR to add a text layer, if necessary, before extracting information.
- Extract information from PDFs programmatically and format the information appropriately.
- Implement quality control and data cleaning measures which handle the most common OCR errors elegantly. 

## Introduction

Over the objections of open data organizations, data archivists [@klindtPDFConsideredHarmful2017], and programmers [@edwardsWhyExtractingData2025;@zhangDocumentParsingUnveiled2024], companies and government agencies frequently use PDF (portable document format) documents to store and release data.
Election results ([Oregon, 2024](https://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Documents/results/november-general-2024-results.pdf)), property appraisals ([Lancaster County, Nebraska](../data/Lancaster-County-NE-Real-Estate-AppraisalCard-28719-2025-147568.pdf)), public health reports ([Centers for Disease Control Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports](../data/cdc-mmwr-2025-07-10.pdf)), and more, locked up [@harbertTappingPowerUnstructured2021] in PDF format instead of stored properly in nicely formatted spreadsheets or databases. 
Even though we object to the storage mechanism, learning how to deal with data stored in PDF format is a valuable skill for the aspiring data scientist. 
Even if you never work with PDF data in a professional capacity (and I hope you're that lucky), these skills are very useful for public data side projects. 

### PDF File Format

The PDF file format was created in 1993 by Adobe and was a proprietary format until 2008, when the format became an open standard under the control of the International Standards Organization [@wikimediacontributorsHistoryPDF2024]. 
As the acronym suggests, Portable Document Format is intended to be readable on any computer. 
This was something of a novel idea in the 1990s, when Mac users used one document creation software and Windows users another, and there was not a version of e.g. Microsoft Office available for Mac.

The technical details of a PDF file are complex [@gnupdfprojectIntroductionPDF2014;@hodsonPDFSuccinctly2012].
However, conceptually, there are four required components to a PDF document, as shown in @fig-pdf-doc-components: 

::: column-margin
![High-level required components of a PDF document.](../images/advanced/pdf-document-components.png){#fig-pdf-doc-components fig-alt="A box containing four colored boxes: Header, Body, Cross-ref table, and Trailer." .lightbox}

![Required components of a PDF Body](../images/advanced/pdf-body-components.png){#fig-pdf-body-components fig-alt="A network diagram showing the Catalog, with an arrow leading to the Page Tree. Below the Page tree are two page nodes, Page 1 and Page 2. Arrows connect the Page tree to the pages, and the pages to the page tree. The final layer of the network contains page 1 content, resources, and page 2 content. Arrows point from page 1 and 2 to the resources node, as well as to the corresponding page content." .lightbox}
:::

- Header
    - PDF version number
    - arbitrary sequence of binary data to prevent applications from opening the document as a text file (which would corrupt the file)
- Body (relationships between body components shown in @fig-pdf-body-components)
    - Page tree - serves as the root of the document, and may be as simple as a list of pages.
    - Pages - each page is defined independently and contains its own metadata, links to resources, and content (defined separately). 
    - Resources - objects required to render a page, such as fonts.
    - Content - text and graphics which appear visually on the page. 
    - Catalog - an indication to programs as to where to start reading the document. Often this is just a link to the root page tree.
- Cross-reference table - Records the location in the file of each object in the body of the file so that when viewing a page, only objects from that page are loaded into memory. 
- Trailer - tells applications how to read the file
    - A reference to the catalog which links to the document root
    - Location of the cross-reference table
    - Size of the cross-reference table

@kingAdobeIntroductionInsides2005 has some good examples showing pages and the PDF document code that create the pages. 

Within the page, **streams** are often used to define the page's appearance (the other option is **lattices**, which can be used to divide the page up into sections). 
To add text, commands are issued to define the font, position the text cursor, and type the text onto the page. 
Text is positioned from the bottom left corner, with $Y$ defining the vertical and $X$ defining the horizontal location. 
Line breaks and other formatting features are not a part of the PDF format -- these operations are performed by another program before the file is saved as PDF. 
As a result, text commands in PDF can be fragmented, leading to a continuous paragraph of words being written in the PDF file as separate lines, with other page elements present in between (like figure captions, page numbers, and images). 
In addition, PDF documents allow for changing the kerning of text (space between letters) in specific ways that may make it difficult for the characters to be separated visually. 
One common example of this is the sequence of characters `ff` or `fi` in a document, which can sometimes be read in interesting ways by OCR: sometimes, as unicode ﬀ or ﬁ, sometimes as Cyrillic characters, and sometimes left out entirely or misplaced.

### Demo: PDF Fun {-}

Consider a [Home appraisal record from Lancaster County, NE](../data/Lancaster-County-NE-Real-Estate-AppraisalCard-28719-2025-147568.pdf). 
Opening the card in a PDF reader and selecting all the text yields a [disorganized text file](../data/Lancaster-County-NE-Real-Estate-AppraisalCard-28719-2025-147568.txt) (and this PDF is actually created using modern methods and relatively clean!)

A few observations, marked up in @fig-pdf-layout-text: 

- The title on page 1 is on line 39 of the file, and it appears that the data from the first column is on lines 1-38. 
- When there are multi-column tables, as in the "Inspection History" table in the middle of the first page, the values are listed by column, but missing values (the times of inspection) are not indicated at all!
- The Appraised Values table has columns Land, Building, Total, and Method. Line 142 of the text file shows an entry for "Total Method", and it is clear that the text for the two columns has been combined. 

![Comparing text of PDF document to the rendered PDF document.](../images/advanced/Lancaster-County-NE-Real-Estate-AppraisalCard-28719-2025-147568.svg){#fig-pdf-layout-text .lightbox fig-alt="A screenshot of the first page of the PDF, with boxes highlighting the locations corresponding to the points shown above. In the Appraised Values table, arrows are shown connecting the Appraised Values header, Land, Building, Total Method, Current, $45,000, $111,000, $156,000 IDXVAL, Prior, $45,000, $111,000, and $156,000 IDXVAL sequentially."}

Now, perhaps we could write a script that would disentangle some of this information and format it properly, though I think the missing values would still be unrecoverable without someone visually mapping the data to the corresponding lines. 

The arrangement of the text you get from selecting all text is different in different PDF applications -- I tried it with [Okular](../data/Lancaster-County-NE-Real-Estate-AppraisalCard-28749-2025-147568.txt) and [Firefox](../data/Lancaster-County-NE-Real-Estate-AppraisalCard-28749-2025-147568-Firefox.txt), and got totally different orders of text boxes. 

The scope of the actual problem only becomes visible when you look at a second [PDF document](../data/Lancaster-County-NE-Real-Estate-AppraisalCard-28749-2025-147568.pdf) and the corresponding [text file](../data/Lancaster-County-NE-Real-Estate-AppraisalCard-28749-2025-147568.txt). 
@fig-pdf-layout-text-parallel shows the two PDF files and their corresponding text files, with the comparable portion of each PDF and text file highlighted. 

![Lancaster county, NE real estate appraisal cards and text, with correpsonding sections highlighted across two appraisal cards. The text corresponding to the same space on the PDF has different formatting because one row of the table is blank on one of the cards.](../images/advanced/Lancaster-County-NE-Real-Estate-AppraisalCard-28749-2025-147568.png){#fig-pdf-layout-text-parallel .lightbox fig-alt="A screenshot of the text files and PDF files for both real estate appraisal cards. The recent appeal history and assessed value history table headers and first row of text are highlighted in both sets of documents."}


:::

Hopefully you're beginning to understand how challenging this whole extracting data from PDFs thing can be!
What we would really want to do here is detect the column boundaries somehow, and then read the data in from each table column-wise - this would be easier than postprocessing it, and we can also get coordinates for x and y to help us determine which data correspond to the same rows.
Hold on to that thought -- we'll come back to it.


## Types of PDF Files

### Layers

Practically, we can think of PDFs as having a text layer, an image layer, or both (hybrid PDFs). 
A PDF with a text layer will allow you to select embedded text and copy it into a text file, while a PDF that just has an image layer does not. 
It is also possible to have a PDF that has an image layer with a corresponding text layer on top. 
Optical Character Recognition takes a PDF with only image layers and creates a text file (or layer, depending on the tool) by  identifying the characters in the document and converting those characters to text with a corresponding $(x,y)$ location in the document.
Different OCR programs use different conventions for this process, and the quality of the image matters a lot as well - some images are just not good enough to produce a passable transcription of the text using automatic methods. 


Thus, if we want to think about classifying PDF files by type, we might come up with the following groups:

- A PDF file that has an image layer, but no text layer. (This is sometimes called a "raster" PDF, because an image that's made up of pixels is a raster image.)
- A PDF file that has a text layer but no image layer is unsurprisingly called a **text** PDF.
- Many files have both text and images; these are **hybrid** PDFs.

How we ingest data from PDF files depends heavily on the type of PDF we have.


:::: demo

#### Demo: Types of PDF Files {-}

For this demo, I've converted the first page of one of the Lancaster county, NE property appraisal PDFs into:

- an [image only PDF](../data/Lancaster-County-NE-Real-Estate-AppraisalCard-28749-2025-147568-pg1-image.pdf) and 
- a [text-based PDF](../data/Lancaster-County-NE-Real-Estate-AppraisalCard-28749-2025-147568-pg1-text.pdf) (the original form). 

::: callout
Open these up in your favorite PDF editor and try to highlight the text in each. How does it work?
:::

We can also examine the format of a PDF file using R and python libraries. 

::: panel-tabset

#### R {-}
You'll need the `pdftools` package, which you can install with `install.packages("pdftools")`. 
This may require you to install `libpoppler` on Linux <i class="fa-brands fa-linux" aria-hidden="true"></i>, but versions for other operating systems should be self-contained. 

The `pdf_info` function gives us information from the PDF header, and the `pdf_text` function tries to extract the text, if it exists. 

##### Text-Based PDF {-}
```{r}
library(pdftools)
library(stringr)

pdf_info("../data/Lancaster-County-NE-Real-Estate-AppraisalCard-28749-2025-147568-pg1-text.pdf")$version
pdf_text("../data/Lancaster-County-NE-Real-Estate-AppraisalCard-28749-2025-147568-pg1-text.pdf") |>
  str_split("\n") |>  # <1>
  unlist() |> # <2>
  head() # <3>
```
1. Split text into lines
2. Remove from list structure -- make a vector
3. Show first few lines

##### Image-Based PDF {-}
```{r}
pdf_info("../data/Lancaster-County-NE-Real-Estate-AppraisalCard-28749-2025-147568-pg1-image.pdf")$version
pdf_text("../data/Lancaster-County-NE-Real-Estate-AppraisalCard-28749-2025-147568-pg1-image.pdf") 
```

#### Python {-}

You will need the `pdfplumber` package [@singer-vinePdfplumber2025], which you can install with pip. 

The `pdf` object contains `metadata` and `pages`, and page text (if it exists) can be accessed with the `pdf.pages[i].extract_text()` method.

##### Text-Based PDF {-}
```{python}
import pdfplumber # <1>
with pdfplumber.open("../data/Lancaster-County-NE-Real-Estate-AppraisalCard-28749-2025-147568-pg1-text.pdf") as pdf: # <2>
  metadata = pdf.metadata # <3>
  first_page =  pdf.pages[0] # <4>
  text = first_page.extract_text() # <5>
  pdf.close()  # <6>

metadata
text.split("\n")[0:5]  # <7>
```
1. Use the `pdfplumber` library
2. Open the file and call it `pdf`
3. Get the metadata
4. Get the data for the first page
5. Extract the text from the first page
6. Close the file (important to release memory)
7. Split the text by `\n` and show the first few lines


##### Image-Based PDF {-}
```{python}
with pdfplumber.open("../data/Lancaster-County-NE-Real-Estate-AppraisalCard-28749-2025-147568-pg1-image.pdf") as pdf:
  metadata = pdf.metadata
  first_page =  pdf.pages[0]
  text = first_page.extract_text()
  pdf.close()

metadata

text.split("\n")[0:5]
```

:::

Notice that the text does not exist for the image-based PDF. 
I created the image version of the PDF by opening the PDF in an image editor and saving the resulting file as PDF within that image editor, so it's not surprising that the text layer is not present in that version of the file. 
::::

### The Trouble with Text Layers

> Data scientists are often interested in data from tables. Unfortunately the pdf format is pretty dumb and does not have notion of a table (unlike for example HTML). Tabular data in a pdf file is nothing more than strategically positioned lines and text, which makes it difficult to extract the raw data... [@oomsPdftoolsTextExtraction2025]

The quote above gives you some idea of the challenge of extracting text from a PDF, but it's likely you've already come across this challenge when trying to copy text out of a PDF and into some other program for editing. 
Incidentally, the PDF representation of text is also a reason why some groups are shifting away from the format entirely -- it is difficult to make PDF documents accessible to screen readers, because the text isn't inherently ordered in any way^[In the US, the Department of Justice's [interpretation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act](https://www.ada.gov/law-and-regs/regulations/title-ii-2010-regulations/) requires state and government services (including education) to meet digital accessibility standards. Many universities directed professors to shift materials to Word or HTML instead of PDF, as making PDFs accessible requires proprietary Adobe software.]


Text extraction from PDFs can be annoying, but extracting structured text in tables is an even harder challenge. 
Hopefully, the next few demonstrations will help you appreciate why it's so challenging, as well as introducing you to the tools you may need to convert image layers to text layers.

### Converting Images to Text Using Optical Character Recognition

In order to covert image layers to text layers, we need to use Optical Character Recognition (OCR). 

Most free OCR tools are based on the `tesseract` library [@weilTesseract2025], which you can access using `pytesseract` in python [@leePytesseractPythontesseractPython2024] or the `tesseract` R package [@tesseract-r] 
You can also run `tesseract` from the command line, if you [install the library](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html) for your operating system and language. 

:::: demo
#### Demo: Optical Character Recognition {-}

::: panel-tabset

##### Bash {-}

For the sake of shorter commands, let's assume I'm working with a 1-page PDF file named `file.pdf` and want to create `file.txt` which contains the text of the image-based PDF.

```{bash, eval = F}
pdftoppm -png ../data/file.pdf file # <1>
tesseract  -l eng ../data/file-1.png ../data/file-1-bash # <2>
```
1. Convert PDF to PNG to work with Tesseract. If the PDF file has more than one page, this will create `file-1.png` ... `file-n.png` images that can be fed into tesseract using a bash for loop. 
2. Extract the text to a text file.

After OCR, you can search for text in the text output, but it doesn't provide all of the features that a hybrid PDF with both an image and a text layer provides -- the text isn't associated with the $(x,y)$ location on the page(s). 
Also, note that the OCR isn't perfect: because the word "Flags:" under Exemptions in the left column is partially obscured, it is transcribed as "Flaas:", which isn't an english word. 
Using OCR can introduce errors in to the data in ways that are not necessarily predictable (though, predictable issues include confusing capital O for 0, lowercase L for 1, and so on). 
However, OCR is miles better than doing things manually!

##### R {-}

On <i class="fa-brands fa-apple" aria-hidden="true"></i> Mac and <i class="fa-brands fa-linux" aria-hidden="true"></i> Linux, you will likely need to install some system packages to make the `tesseract` package installable. 
```
Try installing:
 * deb: libtesseract-dev libleptonica-dev (Debian, Ubuntu, etc)
 * rpm: tesseract-devel leptonica-devel (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL)
 * brew: tesseract (Mac OSX)
```

The <i class="fa-brands fa-windows" aria-hidden="true"></i> Windows R package should contain the dependencies required. 

```{r}
# install.packages("tesseract")
library(tesseract)
library(pdftools)
library(stringr)

pdf_convert(pdf = "../data/file.pdf", filenames = "../data/file-%d-r.%s") # <1>
text <- ocr("../data/file-1-r.png", engine = tesseract("eng")) # <2>
writeLines(text, "../data/file-1-r.txt")
```
1. Convert the pdf to an image. Provide placeholder `%d` in the string for the number, and `%s` in the string for the extension. 
2. Run OCR on the image using the english language engine

Why is this OCR version so much worse than the version using Bash? They're using the same `tesseract` library under the hood!

A look at the documentation of `pdftoppm` suggests that the default resolution is 150 DPI for image conversion, where the default resolution used by `pdf_convert` in R is 72 DPI. 
If we pass in 150 DPI, what happens?

```{r}
library(tesseract)
library(pdftools)
library(stringr)

pdf_convert(pdf = "../data/file.pdf", dpi  = 150, filenames = "../data/file-%d-r-150dpi.%s")
text <- ocr("../data/file-1-r-150dpi.png", engine = tesseract("eng"))
writeLines(text, "../data/file-1-r-150dpi.txt")
```

```{bash}
#| echo: false
cat ../data/file-1-r-150dpi.txt
```
:::

##### Python {-}

If you don't have the image created, you have to first create an image (`imgBlob`) for each page, and then run `image_to_string` on that image. 
Note that this method does not require that you write the image out to a separate file: the image is only stored in memory.
This might be preferable to the bash method, which produces one file for each PDF page and will use up disk space unless you delete the intermediate files at some point after the text extraction is complete. 

```{python}
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract
from pdf2image import convert_from_path

pages = convert_from_path("../data/file.pdf") # <1>

for pageNum,imgBlob in enumerate(pages): 
  text = pytesseract.image_to_string(imgBlob, lang='eng') # <2>
  with open(f'../data/file-{pageNum+1}-py.txt', 'a') as the_file: # <3>
    the_file.write(text) # <3>
```
1. Read in the PDF (by default, uses 200 dpi)
2. Run OCR on each page of the PDF
3. Write a file for each page of the PDF containing the text from OCR.


If you already have the image created, it's simple to get the text out with `pytesseract`, using `Image.open(<file>)` instead of `convert_from_path()`. 

```{python}
pytesseract.image_to_string(Image.open('../data/file-1.png')).split("\n")[0:5] 
```

##### Assessment of OCR Methods {-}

What is interesting is that even when controlling the DPI, the OCR programs in each language generate different text files. Bash and python are fairly similar, but R's text file is ordered by horizontal lines, not columns. 
It seems likely that we could probably fix the issue if we got the right set of options, but a more straightforward option might be to crop the images into separate chunks for each table and section. That might produce cleaner and more interpretable OCR'd images. 
If we wanted to process many of these files and ingest the information into a database, then we would need to ensure that we could determine how to crop the images 

::::

In many cases, we don't want to deal with only a text file - we want the context of the image, but we'd like to be able to see the text, use Ctrl/Cmd-F to find the right page, and copy the text back out of the file.

Consider [Hamlet](../data/hamlet-shakespeare.pdf), which I downloaded from [The Internet Archive](https://ia801907.us.archive.org/1/items/hamletby00shakuoft/hamletby00shakuoft.pdf) - it has the original text, but it also has a text layer that allows you to search through the document and find, for instance, the 11 instances of the word "skull", four of which are on page 82. 
In general, the text layer is either not displayed, or, more commonly, situated behind the image layer, allowing the reader to access the words without showing the text over top of the image. 
How are these hybrid PDF documents created?

::: demo
#### Demo: Creating Hybrid PDFs {-}

When I need OCR and don't necessarily want to bother with R, I prefer to use a program called [`ocrmypdf`](https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF) that is based on tesseract and available for most distributions.
I started using `ocrmypdf` before I realized that it's actually a python package that can just be called from the Linux command line. 
In any case, it's possible to use this command within R or Python, but once you have the python package installed and the binary in your system path, it's just as easy to use the program from the terminal -- everything else is just overhead.

Let's OCR the Lancaster county, NE home appraisal image PDF and see what we come up with.

```{bash, eval=F}
ocrmypdf -l eng ../data/file.pdf ../data/file-ocrmypdf.pdf
```


The output of `ocrmypdf` is a [hybrid PDF](../data/file-ocrmypdf.pdf) that has the text and image data superimposed (the text is not visible until you highlight it).

## Working with PDFs Programmatically

### Reading Text from Raster-based PDFs
In many real-world situations, we may not need to read tabular data out of a PDF. 
For instance, Google's [Library Project](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9690276?hl=en) scanned millions of books, allowing them to show [the frequency of a word's use over time](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=delved&year_start=1800&year_end=2022&corpus=en&smoothing=3&case_insensitive=false). 
This wouldn't be possible without a very good OCR library (which is one reason Google took over `tesseract` when IBM open-sourced it). 

The primary challenges when the goal is reading in text from an OCR'd PDF are:

1. If documents are the result of lower-quality scans, noise removal, background removal, and brightness/contrast adjustments may be necessary before the OCR step. 
2. Ensuring word order is maintained across lines
3. Removing page numbers and header/footer information

:::: demo
#### Demo: Trial Transcripts

Let's start out with a relatively simple case, based on a real problem I tried to tackle in 2022. 
We have a number of court trial transcripts, and we want to systematically search for certain phrases to determine how common they are. 
We'll ignore, for now, the problem of actually understanding what the words are saying and classifying that properly (that would require language or topic modeling), and focus on the problem of even getting the trial transcripts converted into plain text in a format which is readable.

### Reading Tabular Data from Text or Hybrid PDFs

As mentioned above, tabular data is a particular challenge to read from PDF files, as the PDF specification doesn't actually have any way to represent structured text. 
There are two common open-source libraries recommended for extracting tabular data from PDFs - `tabula`, which is a Java library [@aristaranTabulapdfTabula2025], and `camelot`, a Python library [@vinayak-mehtaCamelotPDFTable2025]. 
There are interfaces to the `tabula` library in both R and Python (`tabulapdf` and `tabula-py`, respectively), but there is no R interface to `camelot`, as far as I am aware. 
In this chapter, I will focus primarily on `tabula`, since it works across both R and Python, but if you ever run into issues using it, consider `camelot` as well -- it has some cool features [@dennisTabulapyVsCamelot2024]. 

Installation of `tabulapdf` in R depends on `rJava`, which can be a bit tricky, particularly on Windows. The [tabulapdf](https://github.com/ropensci/tabulapdf/) github page has more detailed instructions for [how to install Java for Windows using Chocolatey](https://github.com/ropensci/tabulapdf/#installing-java-on-windows-with-chocolatey). 

:::: example

#### Example: BLS 

The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides monthly Consumer Price Index news releases. 
An archive of these releases is available at https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm. 
Let's acquire 2 years worth of monthly CPI reports, and focus on trying to extract the first table, "Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U): US city average, by expenditure category".

##### Acquiring 2 years of BLS CPI news releases

As this material is covered in @sec-data-web, I'm just going to provide the code to do this in R -- you can see equivalent python commands in @sec-data-web. 
After having done this in R, I realized I probably could have accomplished the same task with a single `wget` command in `bash`, the lesson being that it is important to pick your tools wisely. 

```{r acquire-bls-pdfs, eval = F}
library(rvest)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)

save_dir <- "../data/bls-pdfs/"
dir.create(save_dir, showWarnings = F)

url <- "https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm"

session <- read_html_live(url)

# PDFs are the 2nd link in each entry
links <- session$html_elements("li a:nth-child(2)")  

# Get the last 2 years of entries
link_tbl <- tibble(link = html_attr(links, "href"), 
                   date = str_extract(link, "\\d{8}")) |>
  na.omit() |>
  mutate(datestr = date, date = mdy(date)) |>
  filter(today() - years(2) <= date)


ua <- "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT x.y; Win64; x64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0"
options(HTTPUserAgent = ua)

filelist <- paste0("https://www.bls.gov", link_tbl$link)
filesave <- paste0(save_dir, basename(link_tbl$link))

# The site is finicky about user agents, so we need to 
# specifically pass that in to the download.file method.
walk2(filelist, filesave, ~download.file(.x, destfile = .y, method = "wget", extra = paste0("-U \"", ua, "\"")))
```

You can either run the code above (assuming you have `wget` on your machine), or you can [download a zip file of the PDFs](../data/bls-pdfs/bls-cpi-pdfs.zip).

##### R {-}

```{r}
# install.packages("tabulapdf")
library(tabulapdf)
library(pdftools)
library(purrr)
library(stringr)

files <- list.files(path = "../data/bls-pdfs", pattern = ".pdf$", full.names=T)

find_page_number <- function(file) {
  txt <- pdf_text(file)
  txt_by_page <- map_chr(txt, ~paste(., collapse=" "))
  which(str_detect(txt_by_page, "Table 1"))
}

# page_numbers <- map_int(files, find_page_number)
page_numbers <- c(9, 10, 8, 9, 8, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 9, 10, 9)

tables <- extract_tables(files[1], page = page_numbers[1],  output = "tibble")[[1]]

head(tables)
```

It appears that `tabulapdf` isn't separating the columns the way we'd prefer. 
Let's see if we can fix that....

There's a function, `locate_areas()`, that works interactively - it opens a viewer tab and you select the table using the mouse, as in @fig-tabulapdf-locate-area. 

::: column-margin
![A screenshot of one page of one of the PDFs, showing how `locate_areas` works.](../images/advanced/tabula-pdf-locate-area.png){#fig-tabulapdf-locate-area .lightbox fig-alt="A screenshot of the `tabulapdf` `locate_area()` function interactive window, showing a highlighted table region."}
:::

`locate_areas` provides a sequence of coordinates that are relatively consistent across multiple full-page tables, so we might try to use those coordinates to improve our table parsing. 

```{r, eval = F}
locate_areas(files[1], pages = rep(page_numbers[1], 5))
```


Here's what I got running this 5 times for the first PDF in the list -- this gives me boundaries for each column (without including the header). 

```

     top     left   bottom    right 
126.1566 535.3054 586.7699 575.2099 

```

We can actually run this for each column, keeping track of the left and right values, to get an even more precise way to read our data in. 
Here are my rough column alignments, using `cpi_01112024.pdf` as a test. 

- Table Start - 35 
- Col2 - 209
- Col3 - 244
- Col4 - 289
- Col5 - 328
- Col6 - 370
- Col7 - 411
- Col8 - 453
- Col9 - 490
- Col10 - 535
- Table End - 575


```{r}
tables <- extract_tables(
  files[1], page = page_numbers[1], 
  guess = F,
  col_names = F, 
  area = list(c(128, 35, 586, 575)), 
  columns = list(c(209, 244, 289, 328, 370, 411, 453, 490, 535))
)[[1]]

head(tables)
```

Ok, that looks good - let's apply it to the rest of the reports now.

```{r}
tables <- map2(files, page_numbers, ~extract_tables(
    .x, page = .y, 
    guess = F,
    col_names = F, 
    area = list(c(128, 35, 586, 575)), 
    columns = list(c(209, 244, 289, 328, 370, 411, 453, 490, 535))
    )[[1]]
  )
```


Then, we can read in the dates that are present in the header row, assuming that the major dividers stay the same between reports.
I used `locate_areas()` to get the coordinates of each header that we care about.

tables[[1]]
```
1. Pull headers out using roughly the same command as we used to get the tables, but with a different top and bottom area.
2. Write a function to clean the headers up a bit
3. `modifiers` are the top row of the variable names that aren't captured by our headers object. They're consistent from report to report. We'll separate the modifier from the dates using `.`, for easier cleaning.
4. Extract only the components of the headers object that are needed -- this depends on whether we're talking about a single month-to-month comparison, or a time span. In the first column, we only need the "expenditure category" object. 
5. Remove all `.` characters from the names so they don't mess up our delimiter, and replace spaces and dashes with `_`. 
6. Paste the two vectors together to get the names.
7. Apply the function to each header
8. Set the names of the variables in each table to the corresponding header.

Then, we just need to clean things up a bit more.

```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
report_date <- str_replace(basename(files), "cpi_(.*)\\.pdf", "\\1") |> mdy() # <1>

cpi_data <- map2(tables, report_date, ~mutate(.x, report_date = .y)) # <2>

cpi_data <- map(
  cpi_data, 
  ~pivot_longer(., -c(Expenditure_category, report_date), # <3>
                names_to="var",  # <3>
                values_to = "val") |> # <3>
    separate(var, c("varname", "vardate"), sep = "\\.") |> # <4>
    pivot_wider(id_cols = c("Expenditure_category", "report_date", "vardate"), names_from = "varname", values_from = "val") # <5>
)

cpi_data <- cpi_data |>
  bind_rows() |>  # <6>
  mutate(Expenditure_category = str_remove_all(Expenditure_category, "[\\. ]{1,}$") |>
           str_trim())  # <7>

dim(cpi_data)
cpi_data
```
1. Determine the date of the report from the filename
2. Add a column with the corresponding report date to each table
3. Convert each table to long form with expenditure category and report date as ID columns. 
4. Split the variable names from the period over which the variable is calculated. In theory, we should be able to determine the lag for each of these and not care about the date, but I don't trust that the report has been that consistent over 2 years... paranoia. 
5. Pivot wider, so that there's a column for each variable name.
6. Bind all the tables together into a single table
7. Clean up the expenditure category names so that the dots are gone. 

We could probably get this data cleaner -- the lagged columns should be specified better, but this will do for now. 
Let's at least do something interesting with this data that wouldn't have been possible without reading data in from the tables.

##### Tabula-Py {-}

If we learned anything from doing this in R, it's that it probably won't work the first time. 
So this code saves a bit of evaluation time by using some of the info we got from R, like the page numbers (I've adjusted these to match python indexing). 

```{python}
import pdfplumber
import tabula
from glob import glob
import numpy as np

files = glob("../data/bls-pdfs/*.pdf")

def find_page_number(file):
  pdf = pdfplumber.open(file)
  has_tb1 = ["Table 1" in i.extract_text() for i in pdf.pages]
  pdf.close()
  return int(np.where(has_tb1)[0][0])

# page_numbers = [find_page_number(i) for i in files]
# page_numbers = [i[0] for i in page_numbers]
page_numbers = [8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 9, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 9, 8]
```

```{python}
tables = tabula.read_pdf(files[0], pages=page_numbers[0]+1)
tables
```

Ok, so this time, we get 5 columns, which isn't quite right - it seems as if the major headers are determining the column structure. 

Let's see if we can define the table area and help things out. 


```{python}
tbl = tabula.read_pdf(files[0], pages=page_numbers[0]+1, area=[128, 35, 586, 575], pandas_options={'header': None})[0]
tbl
```

```{python}
from itertools import chain
import pandas as pd

header = tabula.read_pdf(files[0], pages=page_numbers[0]+1, area=[89, 35, 128, 575], pandas_options={'header': None})[0]

def fix_headers(tbl): # <1>
  modifiers=[["", "Rel_imp."], ["Unadj_idx."]*3, ["Unadj_pct_chg."]*2, ["Seas_adj_pct_chg."]*3] # <2>
  modifiers=list(chain.from_iterable(modifiers)) # <3>
  # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11860476/how-to-unnest-a-nested-list
  
  spans=pd.Series([tbl.loc[0,0],  # <4>
  ''.join(tbl.loc[1:2,1]),  # <4>
  ''.join(tbl.loc[1:2,2]),  # <4>
  ''.join(tbl.loc[1:2,3]),  # <4>
  ''.join(tbl.loc[1:2,4]),  # <4>
  ''.join(tbl.loc[0:3,5]),  # <4>
  ''.join(tbl.loc[0:3,6]),  # <4>
  ''.join(tbl.loc[0:3,7]),  # <4>
  ''.join(tbl.loc[0:3,8]),  # <4>
  ''.join(tbl.loc[0:3,9])])  # <4>
  spans=spans.str.replace("\.", "", regex = True)  # <5>
  spans=spans.str.replace("[ -]", "_", regex = True)  # <5>
  
  return modifiers + spans

header = fix_headers(header)  # <6>
header

def read_table_1(file, page_number):   # <7>
  tbl    = tabula.read_pdf(file, pages=page_number+1, area=[128, 35, 586, 575], pandas_options={'header': None})[0]  # <8>
  header = tabula.read_pdf(file, pages=page_number+1, area=[ 89, 35, 128, 575], pandas_options={'header': None})[0]   # <9>
  header=fix_headers(header)  # <10>
  tbl = tbl.rename(header, axis=1)  # <11>
  return tbl

tables = [read_table_1(file, page_numbers[i]) for i,file in enumerate(files)]   # <12>
tables[2]
```
1. Define a function to fix header text
2. First, create a nested list of modifiers that will repeat as many times as there are nested columns
3. Unnest the list of modifiers
4. Put the pieces of each header together properly
5. Clean up the header pieces a bit
6. Apply the function to one header to see if it works
7. Write a function to read table 1 from each report
8. First, read the contents of the table
9. Then, read in the header from the table
10. Fix the header using the `fix_header` function
11. Rename the columns of the table contents with the header values.

Then we just need to clean things up a bit more.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import os

report_date = pd.Series([os.path.basename(i) for i in files]) # <1>
report_date = report_date.str.replace("cpi_|\.pdf$", "", regex=True) # <1>
report_date = pd.to_datetime(report_date, format="%m%d%Y") # <1>

cpi_data = pd.DataFrame()
for i,tbl in enumerate(tables):
  tbl['report_date'] = report_date[i] # <2>
  tbl = tbl.melt(id_vars=['Expenditure_category', 'report_date'], value_name='val', var_name='var') # <3>
  cols = pd.DataFrame(tbl['var'].str.split("\.").to_list(), columns=['varname', 'vardate'])
  tbl = pd.concat([tbl, cols], axis = 1) # <4>
  tbl = tbl.set_index(['report_date', 'Expenditure_category', 'vardate']) # <5>
  tbl = tbl.drop(['var'], axis=1) # <5>
  tbl_wide = tbl.pivot(columns='varname', values = 'val') # <5>
  tbl_wide = tbl_wide.reset_index() # <5>
  cpi_data = pd.concat([cpi_data, tbl_wide], axis=0) # <6>

cpi_data['Expenditure_category'] = cpi_data['Expenditure_category'].str.replace("[ \.]{1,}$", "", regex=True) # <7>

cpi_data.shape
cpi_data.head
```
1. Determine the date of the report from the filename
2. Add a column with the corresponding report date to each table
3. Convert each table to long form with expenditure category and report date as ID columns.

Transit is the next highest, and starts at around 360, increasing steadily with only a few wobbles to 400 by June 2025. Shelter costs are just below Transit, increasing from 350 to about 400 over the period of the graphs in almost an entirely linear fashion. Food increases slightly from 300 to about 325. Energy starts at just above 300 and oscillates in an irregular fashion over the 3-year period. Finally, goods are almost entirely flat at perhaps 175."



tmp = cpi_data.query("~vardate.str.contains(r'_')")
