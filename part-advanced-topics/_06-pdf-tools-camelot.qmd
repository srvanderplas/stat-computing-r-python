##### Camelot (Python) {-}

If we learned anything from doing this in R, it's that it probably won't work the first time.
So this code saves a bit of evaluation time by using some of the info we got from R, like the page numbers (I've adjusted these to match python indexing).


```{python}
import pdfplumber
from glob import glob
import numpy as np

files = glob("../data/bls-pdfs/*.pdf")

def find_page_number(file):
  pdf = pdfplumber.open(file)
  has_tb1 = ["Table 1" in i.extract_text() for i in pdf.pages]
  pdf.close()
  return int(np.where(has_tb1)[0][0])

# page_numbers = [find_page_number(i) for i in files]
# page_numbers = [i[0] for i in page_numbers]
page_numbers = [8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 9, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 9, 8]

# %pip install camelot-py[base]
import camelot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
tables = camelot.read_pdf(files[0], pages='9')
tables
tables[0].parsing_report
tables[0].df

camelot.plot(tables[0], kind='grid')
plt.show()

camelot.plot(tables[0], kind='contour')
plt.show()

```
