## Python Package Installation 

You will need the `numpy` and `pandas` packages for this section. Pick one of the following ways to install python packages:

::: panel-tabset
### System Terminal

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| label: bash-install-python-pkgs
pip3 install numpy pandas lxml
```

### R Terminal

This package installation method requires that you have a virtual environment set up (that is, if you are on Windows, don't try to install packages this way).

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: r-install-python-pkgs
reticulate::py_install(c("numpy", "pandas", "lxml"))
```

### Python Terminal

In a python chunk (or the python terminal), you can run the following command. This depends on something called ["IPython magic"](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#) commands, so if it doesn't work for you, try the System Terminal method instead.

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| label: py-install-python-pkgs
%pip3 install numpy pandas lxml
```

## Data Structures Overview {.intro}

In @sec-basic-var-types, we discussed 4 different data types: strings/characters, numeric/double/floats, integers, and logical/booleans. As you might imagine, things are about to get more complicated.

Data **structures** are more complex arrangements of information, but they are still (usually) created using the same data types we have previously discussed. 

|             | Homogeneous   | Heterogeneous |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1D          | vector        | list          |
| 2D          | matrix        | data frame    |
| N-D         | array         |               |

### Opinionated Structures

Those of you who have taken programming classes that were more computer science focused will realize that I am leaving out a lot of information about lower-level structures like pointers. 
I'm making a deliberate choice to gloss over most of those details in this chapter, because it's already hard enough to learn 2 languages worth of data structures at a time.
In addition, R doesn't have pointers [No Pointers in R, @matloffArtProgrammingTour2011], so leaving out this material in python streamlines teaching both two languages, at the cost of overly simplifying some python concepts. 
If you want to read more about the Python concepts I'm leaving out, check out @frippAnswerPythonPandas2016.

:::

In any data structure, it's important to be able to pull smaller pieces of data out of the structure. 
We do this via **indexing**. 

There are three main approaches to accessing information using indexes:

1. Object Names    
In some cases, components of a data structure are **named** and can be accessed using those names.

2. Location    
Think of a location index as accessing the nth item in a list, or accessing cell A5 in an Excel spreadsheet - you have strict directions as to what row/column or item to get. 

3. Logical Indexing    
In a logical index, you access all items in a structure for which a condition is TRUE. This would be like making a list of family members, and then assigning bedtimes using a statement like "all of the children go to bed at 8pm" - first you decide whether a person is a child, and then you can assign the appropriate bedtime if child is true.

In both R and Python, we will primarily use square brackets to index different data types. 
When the data type is rectangular (has both rows and columns), we will use `[row, column]` syntax -- that is, `[1, 3]` says access the first row, third column. 
When the data type is a vector, we will use `[item]` indexing.

Another important difference to keep in mind is that in R, items are 1-indexed -- that is, the first item in a list `x` is `x[1]`. 
In Python, on the other hand, items are 0-indexed -- the first item in a list `y` is `y[0]`. 


## Vectors

A **vector** is a one-dimensional column of homogeneous data. 
**Homogeneous** means that every element in a vector has the same data type.

We can have vectors of any data type and length we want: 

![vectors of different data types](../images/gen-prog/lego-set-of-vectors.png){fig-alt="A picture of several stacks of lego bricks. First, there is a set of green-hued 1x1 bricks labeled `int`. Next, there is a set of red-hued 1x1 bricks labeled `lgl`, or logical. Then, there is a set of blue-hued 1x2 bricks labeled `float` and finally, a set of 1x3 purple-hued bricks labeled string. Each set of colored bricks has a different length."}


### Indexing by Location {#sec-indexing}

Each element in a vector has an **index** - an integer telling you what the item's position within the vector is. I'm going to demonstrate indices with the string vector

::: panel-tabset
#### R {.unnumbered}

In R, we create vectors with the `c()` function, which stands for "concatenate" - basically, we stick a bunch of objects into a row.

```{r}
#| label: vector-creation-r
digits_pi <- c(3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5)

# Access individual entries
digits_pi[1]
digits_pi[2]
digits_pi[3]

# R is 1-indexed - a list of 11 things goes from 1 to 11
digits_pi[0]
digits_pi[11]

# Print out the vector
digits_pi
```

#### Python Vectors {.unnumbered}

In python, we create vectors using the `array` function in the numpy module. 
To add a python module, we use the syntax `import <name> as <nickname>`. 
Many modules have conventional (and very short) nicknames - for `numpy`, we will use `np` as the nickname. 
Any functions we reference in the `numpy` module will then be called using `np.fun_name()` so that python knows where to find them.[^05-vectors-2]

```{python}
#| label: vector-creation-python-1
import numpy as np
digits_list = [3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5]
digits_pi = np.array(digits_list)

# Access individual entries
digits_pi[0]
digits_pi[1]
digits_pi[2]

```

```{python}
#| label: vector-creation-python-2
#| error: true
# Python is 0 indexed - a list of 11 things goes from 0 to 10
digits_pi[0]
digits_pi[11] 

# multiplication works on the whole vector at once
digits_pi * 2

# Print out the vector
print(digits_pi)
```

#### Python Series (Pandas)

Python has multiple things that look like vectors, including the `pandas` library's Series structure. 
A **Series** is a one-dimensional array-like object containing a sequence of values and an associated array of labels (called its index).


```{python}
#| label: series-pandas-1
#| error: false
import pandas as pd

digits_pi = pd.Series([3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5])

# Access individual entries
digits_pi[0]
digits_pi[1]
digits_pi[2]
```

```{python}
#| label: series-pandas-2
#| error: true
# Python is 0 indexed - a list of 11 things goes from 0 to 10
digits_pi[0]
digits_pi[11] # This errors out

# logical indexing works here too
digits_pi[digits_pi > 3]
digits_pi.loc[digits_pi > 3]

# simple multiplication works in a vectorized manner
# that is, the whole vector is multiplied at once
digits_pi * 2

# Print out the series
print(digits_pi)
```

The Series object has a list of labels in the first printed column, and a list of values in the second. 
If we want, we can specify the labels manually to use as e.g. plot labels later:

```{python}
#| label: series-pandas-3
import pandas as pd
weekdays = pd.Series(['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'], index = ['S', 'M', 'T', 'W', 'R', 'F', 'Sat'])

```

```{python}
#| label: series-pandas-4
#| error: true
# access individual objs
weekdays.iloc[0]
weekdays.iloc[1]
weekdays.loc['S']
weekdays.loc['Sat']

# access the index
weekdays.index
weekdays.index[6] = 'Z' # you can't assign things to the index to change it

weekdays
```

:::

[^05-vectors-2]: A similar system exists in R libraries, but R doesn't handle multiple libraries having the same function names well, which leads to all sorts of confusion. At least python is explicit about it.

We can pull out items in a vector by indexing, but we can also replace specific things as well:

```{r}
#| label: cat-vector-indexing
favorite_cats <- c("Grumpy", "Garfield", "Jorts", "Jean")

favorite_cats

favorite_cats
```

#### Python {.unnumbered}

```{python}

### Indexing with Logical Vectors

As you might imagine, we can create vectors of all sorts of different data types. 
One particularly useful trick is to create a **logical vector** that goes along with a vector of another type to use as a **logical index**.

![lego vectors - a pink/purple hued set of 1x3 bricks representing the data and a corresponding set of 1x1 grey and black bricks representing the logical index vector of the same length](../images/gen-prog/lego-logical-full.png)

If we let the black lego represent "True" and the grey lego represent "False", we can use the logical vector to pull out all values in the main vector.

| Black `==` True, Grey `==` False                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Grey `==` True, Black `==` False                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| ![a pink/purple-hued set of 1x3 bricks representing a vector and a corresponding set of 1x1 black bricks representing the logical index vector of the same length. The grey bricks (and corresponding values of the previous vector) have been removed (filtered out).](../images/gen-prog/lego-logical-black.png) | ![a pink/purple-hued set of 1x3 bricks representing a vector and a corresponding set of 1x1 grey bricks representing the logical index vector of the same length. The black bricks (and corresponding values of the previous vector) have been removed (filtered out).](../images/gen-prog/lego-logical-grey.png) |

Note that for logical indexing to work properly, the logical index must be the same length as the vector we're indexing. 
This constraint will return when we talk about data frames, but for now, just keep in mind that logical indexing doesn't make sense when this constraint isn't true.

bad_pets = np.invert(good_pets) # Invert the logical vector 
                                # so True -> False and False -> True

animals[good_pets]
animals[bad_pets]

animals[~good_pets] # equivalent to using bad_pets
```

#### Logical Operations on Vectors {.intermediate .advanced}

Indexing with logical vectors is an extremely powerful technique -- so much so that it is worthwhile to quickly review how logical operations can be combined.
In both R and Python, we can operate on logical vectors with standard operators -- AND, OR, and NOT. 

::: panel-tabset

##### R

```{R}
# This set of code converts pi to a character, 
# splits the string into single-character pieces,
# converts it back to numbers, 
# and removes the NA resulting from converting '.' to a number.
x <- na.omit(as.numeric(strsplit(as.character(pi), "")[[1]]))
```

##### Python


:::


### Math with Vectors {.intermediate .advanced}

In order to talk about mathematical operations on (numerical) vectors, we first need to consider different ways we could combine vectors. 
If the vectors are the same length, we could perform mathematical operations on the elements (and if they're not the same length we could come up with some convention to coerce them to be the same length). 

\begin{align}
\left[\begin{array}{c}a_1\\a_2\\a_3\end{array}\right] + \left[\begin{array}{c}b_1\\b_2\\b_3\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{c}a_1+b_1\\a_2 + b_2\\a_3 + b_3\end{array}\right]
\end{align}

: Element-wise sum of two vectors

We could also think about performing mathematical operations on all of the entries in a vector - e.g. taking the sum of all vector entries, or the mean, or the standard deviation. 
This reduces a vector of numbers to a single (scalar) number via a defined function. 
We can use standard built-in functions, or we could define our own (see @sec-functions). 

Another option is to think of vectors as a way to specify items, and define mathematical ways to combine different sets of items. 
These vector operations are more akin to set operations, where the product of two vectors is the product set of all combinations of an item from vector 1 and an item from vector 2. 
Technically, these operations are typically also defined for lists, but they may make more sense in practice when the vector same-type constraint is imposed. 

We can finally combine vectors using linear algebra; if you are interested in these definitions, see @sec-matrix-calcs. 

#### Element-wise Operations

When using numeric vectors, the element-wise operations are the same for vectors and scalars (@tbl-math-operators2 is the same exact table as @tbl-math-operators in @sec-calculator). 

| Operation        | R symbol | Python symbol |
|------------------|----------|---------------|
| Addition         | `+`      | `+`           |
| Subtraction      | `-`      | `-`           |
| Multiplication   | `*`      | `*`           |
| Division         | `/`      | `/`           |
| Integer Division | `%/%`    | `//`          |
| Modular Division | `%%`     | `%`           |
| Exponentiation   | `^`      | `**`          |

#### Vector-to-Scalar Operations

Let's cover a few built-in or commonly-used vector summary operations here, focusing on those which are most useful for statistics. 

Function | R | Python
---- | ---- | ----
length | `length(x)` | `len(x)`
mean | `mean(x)` | `x.average()`
variance | `var(x)` | `x.var()`
standard deviation | `sd(x)` | `x.std()`
maximum | `max(x)` | `x.max()`
location of maximum | `which.max(x)` | `x.argmax()`
minimum | `min(x)` | `x.min()`
location of minimum | `which.min(x)` | `x.argmin()`

::: panel-tabset
##### R
```{r}
set.seed(30420983)
x <- sample(1:100, size = 10)
x
length(x)
mean(x)
var(x)
sd(x)
max(x)
min(x)
which.max(x)
which.min(x)
 
# 5 number summary + mean
summary(x)
```


##### Python

```{python}
import numpy as np
import random # need for setting the seed

random.seed(30420983)
x = random.sample(range(1, 101), 10)
x = np.array(x)
x
len(x)
x.mean()
x.var()
x.std() 
x.max()
x.min()
x.argmax()
x.argmin()
```

If we want to use Pandas, we can get a summary of our vector using `.describe()`, but this requires converting our numpy array to a Pandas series.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
x = pd.Series(x)
x
x.describe()
```

:::


#### Set Operations

There are 3 basic set operations: union, intersection, and set difference, as well as the Cartesian product. 
The Cartesian product creates a set of points in vector space (in math terms) or tuples (in python terms), which is usually represented as something other than a vector (in R, a data frame). 

Generally speaking, all of these operations would be valid on lists as well as vectors in R, though in python, these functions are part of `numpy` and require 1-dimensional arrays. 
There are certainly ways to implement set operations in base python, but they typically do not have convenient named functions - you'd need to write your own or import another library. 


Operation | Definition | Symbol (Math) | R function | Python function
---- | ----  | ---- | ---- | ----
Union | All elements in A or B | $A \cup B$ | `union(A, B)` | `np.union1d(A, B)`
Intersection | Elements in both A and B | $A \cap B$ | `intersect(A, B)` | `np.intersect1d(A, B)`
Set Difference | Elements in A but not B | $A \setminus B$ | `setdiff(A, B)` | `np.setdiff1d(A, B)`
Cartesian Product | Combination of each element in A with each element in B | $expand.grid(A, B)$ | ... it's complicated, see code. 

::: panel-tabset
##### R


```{r}
A = c(1:4)
B = c(1:5) * 2 # evens

union(A, B)
intersect(A, B)
setdiff(A, B)
setdiff(B, A) 
expand.grid(A, B) # this is a data frame
```

##### Python

```{python}
import numpy as np

A = np.array(range(1, 5))
B = np.array(range(1, 6)) * 2

np.union1d(A, B)
np.intersect1d(A, B)
np.setdiff1d(A, B) 
np.setdiff1d(B, A)
```

To combine numpy arrays with a Cartesian product in base Python, we have to use something called **list comprehension**. 
I'll leave this example here, but you don't need to fully understand how it works yet, as it is using for loops in a python-centric way.

```{python}
[[a0, b0] for a0 in A for b0 in B] # sets of coordinates
[[(a0, b0) for a0 in A] for b0 in B] # vectors of coordinates
```

We can also use a library that implements the Cartesian product explicitly, and then convert the result to a data type we would prefer to work with, like an array of coordinates, or a data frame. 

```{python}
# Using a library
import itertools
np.array(list(itertools.product(A, B))) # array of 2d coords
pd.DataFrame(list(itertools.product(A, B))) # data frame
```

### Reviewing Types

As vectors are a collection of things of a single type, what happens if we try to make a vector with differently typed things?

c(2L, FALSE, 3.1415, "animal") # <1>
c(2L, FALSE, 3.1415) # <2>

```
1. all converted to strings
2. converted to numerics
3. converted to integers

```
1. all converted to strings
2. converted to numerics
3. converted to integers

:::

As a reminder, this is an example of **implicit** type conversion - R and python decide what type to use for you, going with the type that doesn't lose data but takes up as little space as possible.

Create a vector of the integers from one to 30. Use logical indexing to pick out only the numbers that are multiples of 3.

#### Challenge

Extra challenge: Pick out numbers which are multiples of 2 or 3, but not multiples of 6!

#### General Solution {.unnumbered}

This operation is **xor**, a.k.a. exclusive or. That is, X or Y, but not both X AND Y.

We can write xor as `(X OR Y) & !(X AND Y)` -- or we can use a predefined function: `xor()` in R, `^` in python.

#### R Solution {.unnumbered}

```{r}
x <- 1:30

x2 <- x %% 2 == 0 # multiples of 2
x3 <- x %% 3 == 0 # multiples of 3
x2xor3 <- xor(x2, x3) 
x2xor3_2 <- (x2 | x3) & !(x2 & x3)
x[x2xor3]
x[x2xor3_2]
```

#### Python Solution {.unnumbered}

```{python}
import numpy as np
x = np.array(range(1, 31))

x2 = x % 2 == 0 # multiples of 2
x3 = x % 3 == 0 # multiples of 3
x2xor3 = x2 ^ x3

x[x2xor3]

## Lists

A **list** is a one-dimensional column of heterogeneous data - the things stored in a list can be of different types.

:::

The most important thing to know about lists, for the moment, is how to pull things out of the list. We call that process **indexing**.

### Indexing

Every element in a list has an **index** (a location, indicated by an integer position)[^05-vectors-1].

[^05-vectors-1]: Throughout this section (and other sections), lego pictures are rendered using https://www.mecabricks.com/en/workshop. It's a pretty nice tool for building stuff online!

::: panel-tabset
#### R concept {.unnumbered}

In R, we count from 1.

![An R-indexed lego list, counting from 1 to 5](../images/gen-prog/list-indexing-r.png){fig-alt="A set of 5 bricks on a virtual lego board. The first brick is a blue 1x1 labeled with a 1. The second brick is a green 1x2, labeled with a 2. The third brick is a pink 1x4 labeled with a 3. The fourth brick is a yellow 1x2, labeled with a 4. The fifth brick is a pink 2x2 labeled with a 5. This represents a list, as the blocks are of different types (sizes)."}

#### R code {.unnumbered}

```{r}
#| error: true
x <- list("a", 3, FALSE)

x[1] # <1>
x[1:2] # <2>

x[[1]] # <3>
x[[1:2]] # <4>
```
1. This returns a list
2. This returns multiple elements in the list
3. This returns the item
4. This doesn't work - you can only use [[]] with a single index

In R, list indexing with `[]` will return a list with the specified elements.

To actually retrieve the item in the list, use `[[]]`. The only downside to `[[]]` is that you can only access one thing at a time.

#### Python concept {.unnumbered}

In Python, we count from 0.

![A python-indexed lego list, counting from 0 to 4](../images/gen-prog/list-indexing-py.png){fig-alt="A set of 5 bricks on a virtual lego board. The first brick is a blue 1x1 labeled with a 0. The second brick is a green 1x2, labeled with a 1. The third brick is a pink 1x4 labeled with a 2. The fourth brick is a yellow 1x2, labeled with a 3. The fifth brick is a pink 2x2 labeled with a 4. This represents a list, as the blocks are of different types (sizes)."}

#### Python code {.unnumbered}

```{python}
x = ["a", 3, False]

x[0]
x[1]
x[0:2]
```

In Python, we can use single brackets to get an object or a list back out, but we have to know how **slices** work. Essentially, in Python, `0:2` indicates that we want objects 0 and 1, but want to stop at 2 (not including 2). If you use a slice, Python will return a list; if you use a single index, python just returns the value in that location in the list.

:::

We'll talk more about indexing as it relates to vectors, but indexing is a general concept that applies to just about any multi-value object.

### Concatenation

Another important thing to know about lists is how to combine them. 
If I have rosters for two classes and I want to make a list of all of my students, I need to somehow merge the two lists together.

::: panel-tabset
#### R

```{r}
class1 <- c("Benjamin Sisko", "Odo", "Julian Bashir", "Jadzia Dax", "Miles O'Brien", "Quark", "Kira Nerys", "Elim Garak")
class2 <- c("Jean-Luc Picard", "William Riker", "Geordi La Forge", "Worf", "Miles O'Brien", "Beverly Crusher", "Deanna Troi", "Data")

students <- c(class1, class2)
students

unique(students) # get only unique names
```

#### Python

```{python}
class1 = ["Benjamin Sisko", "Odo", "Julian Bashir", "Jadzia Dax", "Miles O'Brien", "Quark", "Kira Nerys", "Elim Garak"]
class2 = ["Jean-Luc Picard", "William Riker", "Geordi La Forge", "Worf", "Miles O'Brien", "Beverly Crusher", "Deanna Troi", "Data"]

students = class1 + class2
students
list(dict.fromkeys(students)) # get only unique names
```

## Matrices

A **matrix** is the next step after a vector - it's a set of values arranged in a two-dimensional, rectangular format. 

::: panel-tabset
### Matrix (Lego) {.unnumbered}

![lego depiction of a 3-row, 4-column matrix of 2x2 red-colored blocks](../images/gen-prog/lego-2x2-matrix.png)

### R {.unnumbered}

```{r}
#| label: matrix-r
# Minimal matrix in R: take a vector, 
# tell R how many rows you want 
matrix(1:12, nrow = 3)

matrix(1:12, ncol = 3) # or columns

# by default, R will fill in column-by-column
# the byrow parameter tells R to go row-by-row
matrix(1:12, nrow = 3, byrow = T)

# We can also easily create square matrices 
# with a specific diagonal (this is useful for modeling)
diag(rep(1, times = 4))
```

### Python {.unnumbered}

In python, matrices are just a special case of a class called `ndarray` - n-dimensional arrays.

```{python}
#| label: matrix-py
import numpy as np
# Minimal ndarray in python by typing in the values in a structured format
np.array([[0,  1,  2],
          [3,  4,  5],
          [6,  7,  8],
          [9, 10, 11]]) 
# This syntax creates a list of the rows we want in our matrix

# Matrix in python using a data vector and size parameters
np.reshape(range(0,12), (3,4))
np.reshape(range(0,12), (4,3)) 
np.reshape(range(0,12), (3,4), order = 'F')
```

In python, we create 2-dimensional arrays (aka matrices) either by creating a list of rows to join together or by reshaping a 1-dimensional array. 
The trick with reshaping the 1-dimensional array is the order argument: 'F' stands for "Fortran-like" and 'C' stands for "C-like"... so to go by column, you use 'F' and to go by row, you use 'C'. 
Totally intuitive, right?

:::

Most of the problems we're going to work on will not require much in the way of matrix or array operations. 
For now, you need the following:

-   Know that matrices exist and what they are (2-dimensional arrays of numbers)
-   Understand how they are indexed (because it is extremely similar to data frames that we'll work with in the next chapter)
-   Be aware that there are lots of functions that depend on matrix operations at their core (including linear regression)

For more on matrix operations and matrix calculations, see @sec-matrix-calcs.

### Indexing in Matrices

Both R and python use \[row, column\] to index matrices. To extract the bottom-left element of a 3x4 matrix in R, we would use \[3,1\] to get to the third row and first column entry; in python, we would use \[2,0\] (remember that Python is 0-indexed).

As with vectors, you can replace elements in a matrix using assignment.

::: panel-tabset
#### R {.unnumbered}

```{r}
my_mat <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3, byrow = T)

my_mat[3,1] <- 500

my_mat
```

#### Python {.unnumbered}

Remember that zero-indexing!

```{python}
import numpy as np

my_mat = np.reshape(range(1, 13), (3,4))

my_mat[2,0] = 500

my_mat
```
:::

### Matrix Operations

There are a number of matrix operations that we need to know for basic programming purposes:

-   scalar multiplication 
$$c*\textbf{X} = c * \left[\begin{array}{cc} x_{1,1} & x_{1, 2}\\x_{2,1} & x_{2,2}\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{cc} c*x_{1,1} & c*x_{1, 2}\\c*x_{2,1} & c*x_{2,2}\end{array}\right]$$
-   transpose - flip the matrix across the left top -\> right bottom diagonal. 
$$t(\textbf{X}) = \left[\begin{array}{cc} x_{1,1} & x_{1, 2}\\x_{2,1} & x_{2,2}\end{array}\right]^T = \left[\begin{array}{cc} x_{1,1} & x_{2,1}\\x_{1,2} & x_{2,2}\end{array}\right]$$
-   matrix multiplication (dot product) - If you haven't had this in Linear Algebra, here's a preview. [See @mathisfunHowMultiplyMatrices2021 for a better explanation]
$$\textbf{X}*\textbf{Y} = \left[\begin{array}{cc} x_{1,1} & x_{1, 2}\\x_{2,1} & x_{2,2}\end{array}\right] * \left[\begin{array}{cc} y_{1,1} \\y_{2,1} \end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{c}x_{1,1}*y_{1,1} + x_{1,2}*y_{2,1} \\x_{2, 1}*y_{1,1} + x_{2,2}*y_{2,1}\end{array}\right]$$ 
Note that matrix multiplication depends on having matrices of compatible dimensions. 
If you have two matrices of dimension $(a \times b)$ and $(c \times d)$, then $b$ must be equal to $c$ for the multiplication to work, and your result will be $(a \times d)$.

::: panel-tabset
#### R {.unnumbered}

```{r}
x <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, byrow = T)
y <- matrix(c(5, 6), nrow = 2)

# Scalar multiplication
x * 3
3 * x

# Transpose
t(x)
t(y)

# matrix multiplication (dot product)
x %*% y
```

#### Python {.unnumbered}

```{python}
import numpy as np
x = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
y = np.array([[5],[6]])

# scalar multiplication
x*3
3*x

# transpose
x.T # shorthand
x.transpose() # Long form

# Matrix multiplication (dot product)
np.dot(x, y)
```
:::

## Arrays

Arrays are a generalized n-dimensional version of a vector: all elements have the same type, and they are indexed using square brackets in both R and python: `[dim1, dim2, dim3, ...]`

I don't think you will need to create 3+ dimensional arrays in this class, but if you want to try it out, here is some code.

::: panel-tabset
### R {.unnumbered}

```{r}
array(1:8, dim = c(2,2,2))
```

Note that displaying this requires 2 slices, since it's hard to display 3D information in a 2D terminal arrangement.

### Python {.unnumbered}

```{python}
import numpy as np

np.array([[[1,2],[3,4]],[[5,6], [7,8]]])
```

## Data Frames {#sec-data-frames}

In the previous sections, we talked about homogeneous structures: arrangements of data, like vectors and matrices, where every entry in the larger structure has the same type. 
In the rest of this chapter, we'll be talking about the root of most data science analysis projects: the data frame.

Like an excel spreadsheet, data frames are arrangements of data in columns and rows.

This format has two main restrictions:

-   Every entry in each column must have the same data type
-   Every column must have the same number of rows

![A lego data frame of 4 columns and 12 rows. Each column is a separate color hue (data type), with slight variations in the hue of each individual bricks.](../images/gen-prog/lego-data-frame.png)

The picture above shows a data frame of 4 columns, each with a different data type (brick size/hue). 
The data frame has 12 rows. 
This picture may look similar to one that we used to show logical indexing in the last chapter, and that is not a coincidence. 
You can get everything from a data frame that you would get from a collection of 4 separate vectors... but there are advantages to keeping things in a data frame instead.


::: callout-caution
### Motivating Data Frames: Working with Multiple Vectors

Consider for a moment https://worldpopulationreview.com/states, which lists the population of each state. 
You can find this dataset in CSV form [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/stat-computing-r-python/main/data/population2024.csv").

In the previous sections, we learned how to make different vectors in R, numpy, and pandas.
Let's see what happens when we work with the data above as a set of vectors/Series compared to what happens when we work with data frames.

::: panel-tabset
#### Python

(I'm going to cheat and read this in using pandas functions we haven't learned yet to demonstrate why this stuff matters.)

```{python}
#| label:  read-state-pops
#| cache: true
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/stat-computing-r-python/main/data/population2024.csv")
list(data.columns) # get names

# Create a few population series
population2024 = pd.Series(data['2024 Population'].values, index = data['State'].values)
population2023 = pd.Series(data['2023 Population'].values, index = data['State'].values)
population2020 = pd.Series(data['2020 Population'].values, index = data['State'].values)
```

Suppose that we want to sort each population vector by the population in that year.

```{python}
#| label: vector-analysis-python
#| dependson: 'read-state-pops'
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/stat-computing-r-python/main/data/population2024.csv")

population2024 = pd.Series(data['2024 Population'].values, index = data['State'].values).sort_values()
population2023 = pd.Series(data['2023 Population'].values, index = data['State'].values).sort_values()
population2020 = pd.Series(data['2020 Population'].values, index = data['State'].values).sort_values()

population2024.head(10)
population2023.head(10)
population2020.head(10)
```

The only problem is that by doing this, we've now lost the ordering that matched across all 3 vectors. 
Pandas Series are great for showing this problem, because they use labels that allow us to reconstitute which value corresponds to which label, but in R or even in numpy arrays, vectors don't inherently come with labels. 
In these situations, sorting by one value can actually destroy the connection between two vectors, in a way that you don't even notice!

#### R

```{r}
#| label: vector-analysis-r
df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/stat-computing-r-python/main/data/population2024.csv")

# Use vectors instead of the data frame
state <- df$State
pop2024 <- df$X2024.Population
pop2023 <- df$X2023.Population
pop2020 <- df$X2020.Population

# Create a vector to index population in 2022 in order
order2024 <- order(pop2024)

# To keep variables together, we have to do things like this:
head(state[order2024])
head(pop2024[order2024])

# It makes more sense just to reorder the whole data frame:
head(df[order2024,])
```

:::

:::

The primary advantage to data frames is that rows of data are kept together. 
Since we often think of a row of data as a single observation in a sample, this is an extremely important feature that makes data frames a huge improvement on a collection of vectors of the same length: it's much harder for observations in a single row to get shuffled around and mismatched!

### Data Frame Basics

In R, data frames are built in as type `data.frame`, though there are packages that provide other implementations of data frames that have additional features, such as the `tibble` package used in many other common packages. 
We will cover functions from both base R and the `tibble` package in this chapter.

In Python, we will use the `pandas` library, which is conventionally abbreviated `pd`. So before you use any data frames in python, you will need to add the following line to your code: `import pandas as pd`.

::: callout-demo

#### Examining Data Frames

::: panel-tabset

##### R {- .unnumbered}

When you examine the structure of a data frame, as shown below, you get each column shown in a row, with its type and the first few values in the column. The `head(n)` command shows the first $n$ rows of a data frame (enough to see what's there, not enough to overflow your screen).

```{r}
#| label: dataframes
data(mtcars) # Load the data -- included in base R
head(mtcars) # Look at the first 6 rows
str(mtcars) # Examine the structure of the object
```

You can change column values or add new columns easily using assignment. 
The `summary()` function can be used on specific columns to perform summary operations (a 5-number summary useful for making e.g. boxplots is provided by default).

```{r}
#| label: dfcols-sum
mtcars$gpm <- 1/mtcars$mpg # gpm is sometimes used to assess efficiency

summary(mtcars$gpm)
summary(mtcars$mpg)
```

Often, it is useful to know the dimensions of a data frame. 
The number of rows can be obtained by using `nrow(df)` and similarly, the columns can be obtained using `ncol(df)` (or, get both with `dim()`). 
There is also an easy way to get a summary of each column in the data frame, using `summary()`.

```{r}
#| label: summary-mtcars
summary(mtcars)
dim(mtcars)
nrow(mtcars)
ncol(mtcars)
```

Missing variables in an R data frame are indicated with `NA`.

##### Python {- .unnumbered}

When you examine the structure of a data frame, as shown below, you get each column shown in a row, with its type and the first few values in the column. 
The `df.head(n)` command shows the first $n$ rows of a data frame (enough to see what's there, not enough to overflow your screen).

```{python}
#| label:  dataframes-py
mtcars = pd.read_csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/mtcars.csv")

mtcars.head(5)

mtcars.info()
```

You can change column values or add new columns easily using assignment. 
It's also easy to access specific columns to perform summary operations. 
You can access a column named xyz using `df.xyz` or using `df["xyz"]`. 
To create a new column, you must use `df["xyz"]`.

```{python}
#| label:  dfcols-sum-py
mtcars["gpm"] = 1/mtcars.mpg # gpm is sometimes used to assess efficiency

mtcars.gpm.describe()
mtcars.mpg.describe()
```

Often, it is useful to know the dimensions of a data frame. 
The dimensions of a data frame (rows x columns) can be accessed using `df.shape`. 
There is also an easy way to get a summary of each column in the data frame, using `df.describe()`.

```{python}
#| label: summary-mtcars-py
mtcars.describe()
mtcars.shape
```

Missing variables in a pandas data frame are indicated with `nan` or `NULL`.

#### Try it out {.unnumbered}

::: panel-tabset

##### Setup {- .unnumbered}

The dataset `state.x77` contains information on US state statistics in the 1970s. By default, it is a matrix, but we can easily convert it to a data frame, as shown below.

```{r}
#| label: state-facts-tryitout
data(state)
state_facts <- data.frame(state.x77)
state_facts <- cbind(state = row.names(state_facts), state_facts, stringsAsFactors = F) 
# State names were stored as row labels
# Store them in a variable instead, and add it to the data frame

row.names(state_facts) <- NULL # get rid of row names

head(state_facts)

# Write data out so that we can read it in using Python
write.csv(state_facts, file = "../data/state_facts.csv", row.names = F)
```

We can write out the built in R data and read it in using `pd.read_csv`, which creates a DataFrame in pandas.

```{python}
#| label: state-facts-tryitout-py
import pandas as pd

state_facts = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/stat-computing-r-python/main/data/state_facts.csv")
```


##### Problem {- .unnumbered}

1. How many rows and columns does it have? Can you find different ways to get that information?

2. The `Illiteracy` column contains the percent of the population of each state that is illiterate. Calculate the number of people in each state who are illiterate, and store that in a new column called `TotalNumIlliterate`. Note: `Population` contains the population in thousands.

3. Calculate the average population density of each state (population per square mile) and store it in a new column `PopDensity`. Using the R reference card, can you find functions that you can combine to get the state with the minimum population density?

##### R Solution {- .unnumbered}

```{r}
#| label:  state-facts-tryitout-solutions-r
# 3 ways to get rows and columns
str(state_facts)
dim(state_facts)
nrow(state_facts)
ncol(state_facts)

# Illiteracy
state_facts$TotalNumIlliterate <- state_facts$Population * 1e3 * (state_facts$Illiteracy/100) 

# Population Density
state_facts$PopDensity <- state_facts$Population * 1e3/state_facts$Area 
# in people per square mile

# minimum population
state_facts$state[which.min(state_facts$PopDensity)]
```


##### Python Solution {- .unnumbered}

```{python}
#| label:  state-facts-tryitout-solutions-py
# Ways to get rows and columns
state_facts.shape
state_facts.index.size # rows
state_facts.columns.size # columns
state_facts.info() # columns + rows + missing counts + data types

# Illiteracy
state_facts["TotalNumIlliterate"] = state_facts["Population"] * 1e3 * state_facts["Illiteracy"]/100

# Population Density
state_facts["PopDensity"] = state_facts["Population"] * 1e3/state_facts["Area"] 
# in people per square mile

# minimum population
min_dens = state_facts["PopDensity"].min()
# Get location of minimum population
loc_min_dens = state_facts.PopDensity.isin([min_dens])
# Pull out matching state
state_facts.state[loc_min_dens]
```

### Creating Data Frames

It is possible to create data frames from scratch by building them out of simpler components, such as lists of vectors or dicts of Series. 
This tends to be useful for small data sets, but it is more common to read data in from e.g. CSV files, which I've used several times already but haven't yet shown you how to do (see @sec-data-input for the full how-to).

::: callout-demo
#### Data Frames from Scratch

::: panel-tabset

##### R {- .unnumbered}


```{r}
#| label:  math-lsd-r
math_and_lsd <- data.frame(
  lsd_conc = c(1.17, 2.97, 3.26, 4.69, 5.83, 6.00, 6.41),
  test_score = c(78.93, 58.20, 67.47, 37.47, 45.65, 32.92, 29.97))
math_and_lsd

# add a column - character vector
math_and_lsd$subjective <- c("finally coming back", "getting better", "it's totally better", "really tripping out", "is it over?", "whoa, man", "I can taste color, but I can't do math")

math_and_lsd
```


##### Python {- .unnumbered}

  "test_score": [78.93, 58.20, 67.47, 37.47, 45.65, 32.92, 29.97]})
math_and_lsd

# add a column - character vector
math_and_lsd["subjective"] = ["finally coming back", "getting better", "it's totally better", "really tripping out", "is it over?", "whoa, man", "I can taste color, but I can't do math"]

math_and_lsd
```

:::

:::

While it's not *so* hard to create data frames from scratch for small data sets, it's very tedious if you have a lot of data (or if you can't type accurately). 
An easier way to create a data frame (rather than typing the whole thing in) is to read in data from somewhere else - a file, a table on a webpage, etc. 
We're not going to go into the finer points of this (you'll get into that in @sec-data-input), but it is useful to know how to read neatly formatted data.

One source of (relatively neat) data is the [TidyTuesday github repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)^[Tidy Tuesday is a collaborative project where the R community gets together and explores a dataset, cleaning it, visualizing it, and generally working to collectively hone R skills together. You can find some very nice YouTube livestreams, as well as lots of examples using the [#tidytuesday twitter tag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tidytuesday).]

::: callout-demo
#### Reading in Data

::: panel-tabset
##### Base R
In Base R, we can read the data in using the `read.csv` function

```{r}
#| label:  read-airmen-r-base
airmen <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-02-08/airmen.csv')
head(airmen)
```

##### `readR` package
If we want instead to create a tibble, we can use the `readr` package's `read_csv` function, which is a bit more robust and has a few additional features.

```{r}
#| label:  read-airmen-r-readr
library(readr)
airmen <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-02-08/airmen.csv')
head(airmen)
```

##### Pandas
In `pandas`, we can read the csv using `pd.read_csv`

```{python}
#| label:  read-airmen-python
import pandas as pd

airmen = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-02-08/airmen.csv")
airmen.head()
```

:::

### Working with Data Frames

Often, we want to know what a data frame contains. 
R and pandas both have easy summary methods for data frames.

::: callout-demo
#### Data Frame Summaries

Notice that the type of summary depends on the data type.

::: panel-tabset
##### R

```{r}
#| label: summary-airmen-r
summary(airmen)

library(skimr) # Fancier summaries
skim(airmen)
```

##### Python


```{python}
#| label:  summary-airmen-python
# All variables - strings are summarized with NaNs
airmen.describe(include = 'all')

# Only summarize numeric variables
airmen.describe(include = [np.number])

# Only summarize string variables (objects)
airmen.describe(include = ['O'])

# Get counts of how many NAs in each column
airmen.info(show_counts=True)
```

In pandas, you will typically want to separate out .describe() calls for numeric and non-numeric columns. Another handy function in pandas is .info(), which you can use to show the number of non-NA values. This is particularly useful in sparse datasets where there may be a LOT of missing values and you may want to find out which columns have useful information for more than just a few rows.
