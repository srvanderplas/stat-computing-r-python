# Other Helpful Programming Resources

This chapter is mostly here to provide a place for me to stick useful references that may help people who are wanting to expand their skills beyond tools covered in this textbook.


## MIT's Missing Semester

This [set of 11 1-hour lectures](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/command-line/) [@anishathalyeMissingSemesterYour] covers topics that will help you develop general programming/computing skills. The topics covered are (mostly) adjacent to things covered in this book (with the exception of version control), but it seems like an excellent way to bone up on skills like how to work with the command line, how to accomplish basic tasks at the command line, and various other things that students tend to struggle with but that we don't usually have time to go over in class in great detail.
