# Tools 

This part of the textbook provides an overview of the different tools we will be using: R, python, quarto, markdown, pandoc, consoles, and so on.
It can be a bit confusing at first, especially if you're not familiar with how your computer works, where files are stored, and different ways to tell your computer what to do.

@sec-computer-basics gives you some important background material about how a computer functions.

@sec-setting-up tells you exactly what software you need to install for the rest of this textbook.
