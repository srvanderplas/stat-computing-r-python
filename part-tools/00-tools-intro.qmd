# Part I: Tools {#sec-part-tools}

This part of the textbook provides an overview of the different tools we will be using: terminals and consoles, R, python, quarto, markdown, pandoc, and git.
It can be a bit confusing at first, especially if you're not familiar with how your computer works, where files are stored, and different ways to tell your computer what to do.

@sec-computer-basics gives you some important background material about how a computer functions.

@sec-setting-up tells you exactly what software you need to install for the rest of this textbook.

@sec-scripts-notebooks discusses the different ways we can talk to R and python, and the pros and cons of each.

@sec-git discusses how to use git (setup is covered in @sec-setting-up) and how to solve common git problems. 

@sec-docs discusses some solutions for dynamic document creation and literate programming (storing code, writeup, and documentation in the same file) using `knitr`, `quarto`, `rmarkdown`, and more.
